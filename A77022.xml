         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:152215:5"/> he produceth to move and draw the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures love thereto, and to cauſe him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light therein: But caſting mine eye, and conſiderations on the other hand, I beheld the preſent ſtate of the Sons and Daughters of men in this Generation, to ſee what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation this habit of Holineſs found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: And loe its intereſt ſeemed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall and mean as to true holineſs in its proper nature; ſcarce here and there a man that affectionately ſeeketh after it in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the contrary.</p>

                  <p>And to this Saint <hi>Peter</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>1 Pet. 4.10, 11. As every man hath received the gift, even ſo miniſter the ſame one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as good Stewards of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold graces of God. If any man ſpeak, let him ſpeak, as the Oracles of God; if any man miniſter, let him do it, as of the ability that God giveth, that God in all things may be glorified through Jeſus Chriſt; to whom be praiſe and cominion for ever and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>The like mind alſo was in <hi>Paul,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to covet earneſtly the beſt gifts; follow after Charity, ſaith he, and deſire ſpiritual gifts; but rather that ye may Propheſie, <hi>Becauſe he that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, ſpeaketh unto men to Edification, and Exhortation, and Comfort, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>14.3.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Moſes,</hi> when his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant would have had him forbid <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> of Propheſying in the Camp, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him thus; <hi>Envyeſt thou for my ſake, would to God all the Lords people were Prophets, and the Lord would put his Spirit upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And although there be now no Propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by extraordinary Revelation, but only that which is ordinarily wrought in the ſoul, through the operative power of the ſpirit in the exerciſe of the mind, and meditations
<pb facs="tcp:152215:7"/> in the word of God: yet the day of ſmall things is not to be deſpiſed; for God will accompliſh his work, not by might, nor by power, but by his own ſpirit; and although theſe enſuing conſiderations be not adorned with variety of tongues, nor ſuch eloquence as humane Wiſdom teatheth; yet now in love they are tendered to thy conſideration: If they bear an harmonious ſound to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and thou receive any Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Comfort thereby, let God have the glory, and me thy prayers for my further growth and increaſe in the grace of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, to whom I deſire to be an obedient Subject and faithful Servant, although unworthy of ſo high a calling, and remain thine in all Chriſtian Office.</p>

                  <p>TWo things are chiefly treated of in this enſuing Treatiſe, the Filthineſs of Sin, and the Excellency of Holineſs; the Covering of a Sinner, and the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Saint: Nothing makes a Wicked man ſo much like the Devil, as Sin; nor nothing makes a Saint ſo much reſemble Chriſt, as doth Grace and Holineſs.</p>

                  <p>Grace makes man more man, yea, more than a man; but Sin un-mans man, yea makes him worſe than a Beaſt: Sin is the Brat and Spawn of the Devil, but Grace is the Seed and Off ſpring of Chriſt; God loaths no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as Sin; yet wicked men love nothing better. Gods great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and labour is to deſtroy Sin; but man reſolves to keep and cheriſh it. O what a Rebel is man to God! Sin is the greateſt Thief and Deceiver in the World (for every one has more or leſs been cheated thereby) yet the moſt of men are greedy to entertain the Cheater. Nothing is ſuch an Enemy to man as Sin, yet but few men will make War againſt it. Sin ſeeks to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ſoul, yet ſome men will rather dye then leave their Sin.</p>
                  <p>O what blindneſs and madneſs is in the heart of man! Sin ſeparates man from God, and hides his face from him, yet man reſolves to hug and hide his Sin. That muſt needs be the greateſt evil, that deprives man of the

                     <p>Firſt, He made choyce of that houſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other, for an houſe of Sacrifice.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.12. <hi>verſe</hi> 16.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, He Sanctifieth that houſe to himſelf for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He placed there his name, that his eyes,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>verſe</hi> 16.</note> and his heart might be there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, He promiſed ſuch acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Worſhip there performed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that diſpenſation, that his eyes ſhould be open, and his ears attentive to the Prayers there made, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. and for a clear Teſtimony thereof, he filled the houſe with his glory, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. In all theſe Conſiderations, Gods faithful people may be accounted his houſe:</p>
                     <p>For firſt, God hath choſen them, and builds them up a Spiritual Houſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>A habitation for God, through the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152215:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> Spirit,</hi> Eph. 2.22. to the uſe of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Service, and the offering up the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Praiſe and Thankſgiving to his name.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He ſanctifieth them, and fitteth them thereunto, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, His eyes and his heart are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, beholding with delight their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and Services performed in Faith and Love.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, He ſo accepts of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip performed in Spirit and Truth, that his ears are open to their Prayers; and for their conſolation and aſſurance, he fills them <hi>with Joy unſpeakable, and full of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. Whence note by the way, that when a peoples Sacrifice of Prayer, and Praiſe, and other obedience, doth ariſe from an in-dwelling of the Spirit of Faith and Sanctifying grace, and is offered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Altar, Jeſus Chriſt, in the golden Cenſer of his merits; this doubtleſs is highly accepted of God, in what place ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be performed according to the words of Chriſt; <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the mid'ſt of them,</hi> Math. 18.20. The Concluſion drawn from theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is this, That although God doth dwell
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:152215:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> in Heaven by his divine Eſſence and all-glorious preſence, and ſo Heaven may properly be called his houſe and dwelling-place; yet God dwelleth alſo ſpiritually in, and among his people, who may be called his houſe or dwelling-place, where he doth Record his Name, and where he doth give his Bleſſings of Grace, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as the Apoſtles in their Epiſtles to the Churches do declare, and the Author to the Hebrews doth teſtifie in theſe words; <hi>But Chriſt, as a Son over his own Houſe, whoſe Houſe are we, if we hold faſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and the Rejoycing of the hope firm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end.</hi> Thus much in Anſwer to the ſecond Queſtion.</p>
                     <p>The third particular we have to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by way of Explication, is, the Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or comly Ornaments of this Houſe, and theſe are here comprehended under the term <hi>Holineſs; Holineſs becometh thine Houſe O Lord:</hi> Holineſs is an Ornament which doth adorn and beautifie both the inſide and outſide of a Chriſtian, or Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Society; it is curiouſly wrought in the inward man by the In-dwellings of Gods holy Word and Spirit in the influences and operations thereof; and it branches forth it ſelf in thoſe viſible actions and practices that are agreeable to Gods Will.</p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:152215:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>This Ornament comprehendeth within its circumference, the great work of Transformation, ſomtimes called Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or new Creation, according to the Apoſtles exhortation. <hi>And be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to this World, but be ye Transformed by the Renewing of your minde, that ye may prove what is that good, that acceptable and perfect Will of God,</hi> Rom. 12.2. And ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.23, 24. <hi>Be ye Renewed in the Spirit of your minde; and that ye put on the New Man, which after God, is Created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs:</hi> When the minde is transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Carnality to ſtand in the things of God, it may then be ſaid to be Holy: The will alſo may be ſaid to be Holy when it is transformed from that ſtubbornneſs and Rebelliouſneſs, which by corrupted Nature it ſtandeth in againſt the will of God, and is become ſubmiſſive and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the will of God, ſo as freely to obſerve it in all his Commands, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſubmit unto his Will in all his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; ſaying, The Will of the Lord be done.</p>
                     <p>So likewiſe the affections, when they are transformed from Earthly objects to Heavenly objects; when the Meditations, Deſires, Love, and Delights, are all
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152215:22" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſeated in God, and in the things of God; this may be accounted holineſs in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man; holineſs in the outward man doth ariſe from this inward work as from the root, and brancheth forth it ſelf in word and action; as that holy man <hi>David</hi> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>That his mouth ſhould ſhew forth the praiſe of God,</hi> Pſal. 34.1. <hi>and his tongue ſhould talk of his Righteouſneſs all the day,</hi> Pſal. 71.24. It was the Prayer of <hi>Paul,</hi> that holy Servant of God, in the behalf of the believing <hi>Romans, That with one mind, and one mouth they might glorifie God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 15.6. The minde and the mouth ſhould go together in thoſe things where the glory of God, and the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church is concerned; yea, all the members of the body, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy Teſtimony; I made haſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed not to keep thy Commandements,</hi> Pſal. 119.59.</p>
                     <p>It is not enough for a man only to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his affections from Carnal objects, but he muſt have alſo his eye fixed upon the Lord, and his Truth, with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors thereof; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.6. <hi>Mine eyes ſhall be upon the Faithful of the Land, that they may dwell with me;</hi>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:152215:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> Neither is it enough for a man to have his hand ſhut from doing any action of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or oppreſſion, but he muſt have it open alſo in doing works of Mercy and Charity, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the Oppreſſed go free, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 58.6. to be ready to Diſtribute, and willing to Communicate to ſuch as are in Want, <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.18. So that when all the faculties of the inward man, and members of the outward man act in their places according to the will of God, by vertue of his ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and quickening Spirit that gives mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereunto: When a man is ſet free from ſin, and become the Servant of God, he hath his fruit unto holineſs, and the end will be Everlaſting Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.22. So that holineſs is the perfection of purity in Nature, Word, and Works; the which perfection is only found in God; but in reference to man, holineſs conſiſteth in pardon of ſin, and in transformation of Nature, by the renewing of the mind, from corrupted Nature to a renewed or new-begotten Nature which is wrought by the operations of the holy-Spirit, in ſuch thoughts, words, and actions as ariſe from that original: And thus much by way of Explication concerning the term <hi>Holineſs.</hi>

                     <p>The fourth particular concerns the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this Ornament which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Text by the term Ever: <hi>Holineſs becometh thine Houſe O Lord for Ever.</hi> The term Ever, doth here ſignifie Time without limitation or end, and ſo it is taken ſomtimes in Scripture: We have the Lords Kingly Office in reſpect of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it, ſet forth by this term Ever; <hi>The Lord ſitteth King for Ever,</hi> Pſal. 29.10. So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſetting forth to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> the ſecond coming of Chriſt, and the happy Eſtate of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at that day, when the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt; <hi>Then we,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which are alive, and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them, to meet the Lord in the aire, and ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord; wherefore comfort one another with theſe words,</hi> Theſ. 4. whence I apprehend the the term Ever to ſignifie Time, without limitation or end, which is alſo called E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, or Life Eternal, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.46. And ſo having conſidered the words by way of Explication, I ſhall proceed to the Doctrine and Application.</p>

                     <p>Agreeable hereunto are the words of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly: To what end this choyce is made; and that is, that we ſhould be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without blame before him in Love. But if it be asked how hath God choſen
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:152215:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> his people in his Son unto holineſs before the foundation of the world? I Anſwer, God did from Eternity ſee the loſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his people, through their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of his Law; and their defaceing his Image of holineſs, in which he did at firſt Create them: He alſo did foreſee, and in himſelf purpoſe and decree a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to his Juſtice, in and by Jeſus Chriſt, his obedience to his juſt Law, which man had tranſgreſſed; and by his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death for ſin in the ſame humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that had ſinned, that thereby a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteouſneſs and Juſtification might be wrought for man-kinde, that all thoſe who through grace, and the operations of the holy Spirit are in time brought over to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, ſhould be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the Law,<note place="margin">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:152215:26" rendition="simple:additions"/> which in time Chriſt by his Spirit ſhould work and effect in them, did accept and chooſe them in this means, to be a people to the praiſe and glory of his grace; in relation whereunto are theſe words of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſians; For we are his Workmanſhip,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordained that we ſhould walk in them,</hi> Eph. 2.10.

                     <p>And by the term Called, I underſtand the operating power of Chriſt's Spirit, bringing perſons into the way of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and inveſting them with the holy Calling, whereby they may receive the priviledges of the Goſpel; that is, Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sanctification, and Juſtification, as <hi>John</hi> 1.12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt doth work either immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly, as in the Apoſtles, or more ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Miniſtry of the Word, plainly and purely ſet forth to the underſtanding, to the producing Faith, Regeneration, and Sanctification, whereby the Creature is called forth to walk with God in that way whereunto it hath pleaſed the Father to annex the promiſe of ſalvation, according to thoſe words of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians;</hi>

Believers therefore are the perſons that are ſaved and called, not according to their works, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the purpoſe and grace of God, given in Chriſt Jeſus before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; ſo that mans works are no ways me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious of Salvation, nor any original ground of Gods love to man; but Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Sanctification, and Glorification, together with all the means appertaining thereunto, are God's free gift to man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Jeſus Chriſt; to the end, that man in a diligent improvement of the ſame, might bring forth the fruit of holineſs to the praiſe &amp; glory of his name; God hath called his people unto holineſs, with an holy calling, therefore it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them always to be an holy people, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their Call.

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The forth Reaſon grounded on <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.7, 8.</note>A fourth Ground and Reaſon, why it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver becometh God's people to be an holy people, is, becauſe God hath enjoyned holineſs upon his people by ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: The Lord ſaid to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom he had given his Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances: <hi>Sanctifie your ſelves therefore, and be ye holy, for I am the Lord your God, and ye ſhall keep my Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,

When thou canſt experience by a ſupernatural work of grace, that thy affections are ſo fixed on the Lord, that thou canſt ſincerely love him for his own ſake; and in love to him, bear an affectionate eſteem to, and delight in his Teſtimonies, Statutes, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and Commands, ſo as to make them thy <hi>choyce,</hi> Pſal. 119.30. or <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen</hi>

                     <p>But on the contrary; if thy mind, will, affection, deſire, delight and meditation is chiefly exerciſed on carnal and wordly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, with expectation of content therein; but as to the things of of God, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern his glory, and the eternal welfare of thy Soul, thou haſt but little affection thereto, thy mind and meditation but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle exerciſed therein, thy love, deſire and delights but cold to the exerciſe thereof; it is an evident ſign thou art but in the Old Man, and in thy corrupt Eſtate, in the carnal mind, earthly affections, obſtinate will, worldly deſires, and vain delights

                     <p>Wherefore firſt: Let us examine our ſelves, and conſider what ſins we have caſt off, what Luſts we have ſubdued, what Corruptions we have conquered, through the holy means and Heavenly calling, and divine aſſiſtance which we have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They that are Chriſts, have Crucified the Fleſh with the affections and Luſts,</hi> Gal. 5.24.</p>
                     <p>Secondly: Let us examine our ſelves, and conſider how far we have proceeded in putting on the New Man; what <hi>Works of Faith?</hi> what <hi>Labour of Love?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1.3.</note> what <hi>Patience of Hope</hi> we have been exerciſed into the glory of his name, that gives the means, and commands obedience.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſome Soul may ſay within it ſelf, <hi>I</hi> have ſpent much time in hearing God's Word Preached, <hi>I</hi> have been often in Prayer and Faſting, and in receiving the

                     <p>Theſe Exerciſes of Preaching and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Gods Word, Prayer and Faſting, Alms and good Deeds done to Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Brethren, are all Duties belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Chriſtian, which he ought to do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of the Gift given: But let us examine our End, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſuch Undertakings; it is the End that crowns the Action: if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form theſe or the like Chriſtian Duties to by and baſe Ends, as to be ſeen of men, to obtain the favour and applauſe of ſome perſons with whom ſuch Duties are in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation; or becauſe it is the Faſhion or Cuſtom of the Countrey wherein we live, at leaſt, of the better ſort: or for lucre of ſome temporal Benefit; or that thereby we might deſerve Gods Love, or purchaſe Heaven. Theſe and the like Ends will be unto our performances, but like unto the dead Flies in the Apothecaries Ointment;

                     <p>But when Chriſtian Performances do flow from an inward work of Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, from a renewed Mind and ſincere Love to God; to the end we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by glorifie him in faithful Obedience to his Commands; and obtain ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt corruptions and temptations that do ſo frequently aſſault us; and that we may be inſtrumental to edifie and build up others alſo in the Knowledg of God, and in obedience to his Will; that they may ſet their hope in God, and glorifie his Name by becoming obedient to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments: then the more active we are in thoſe Chriſtian Duties, the more is our Comlineſs in the fruits of Holineſs; the more is our power and ſtrength againſt our Corruptions; the more increaſe of Grace; the more communion with God; the more we glorifie his Name, the more peace of Conſcience, the more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table enjoyments of Gods Favour, and the more rejoycing in his Promiſe of our eternal Happineſs through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>Wherefore let us examine our ſelves, firſt, whether we are moved or acted by a right Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> an inward work of the Spirit of Grace, quickening, ſanctifying and renewing the inward man.

Hath God choſen his people in Chriſt, that they ſhould be holy, hath he called them thereunto with an holy Calling; hath he commanded them to be holy in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Converſation. Then let us be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to ſtrive to anſwer Gods end in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting, calling and commanding us to be holy, by preſſing after Holineſs in the uſe of that means that God hath ordained to accompliſh that End: let us put on that noble Spirit of Bleſſed <hi>Paul,</hi> that Servant of God; <hi>I preſs towards the Mark,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for the price of the high Calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Phil. 3.14. Holineſs is an high Calling; yea, it is an high Calling of God in Jeſus Chriſt, well becoming the people of God. Men are moſt earneſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:152215:37" rendition="simple:additions"/> a Comodity when they conſider theſe two particulars in it: firſt, the Neceſſity of it: ſecondly, the Excellency of it: wherefore to preſs on the Exhortation on our Spirits, let us conſider Holineſs in theſe two particulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Holineſs is of great neceſſity: <hi>for,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, <hi>without Holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Hebr. 12.14. Want of Holineſs deprives a Soul of the comfortable enjoyment of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adam</hi> when he had defiled himſelf with Sin was thruſt out of Paradice from the comfortable enjoyments and paradicical priviledges he was there inveſted with.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that wicked men may, and many times do, enjoy a great meaſure of this worlds felicity, in reſpect of the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Honours and Pleaſures thereof; while Gods faithful Servants ſuffer hard things: which made <hi>David</hi> at a ſtand till he went into the Sanctuary of God, and gained underſtanding in the Promiſes of true Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity in eternal life made to the ſanctified ones: and then he underſtood the End of thoſe wicked and unholy men. That as to true peace with God, and aſſurance of his favour, as to enjoyment of Communion with him in Grace here, or in Glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, there is no Promiſe made to them
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:152215:37" rendition="simple:additions"/> in that their unſanctified eſtate: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he puts on this reſolution: <hi>But as for me, I will behold thy Face in righteouſneſs: I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſs,</hi> Pſal. 17.15. There is no behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding God without Holineſs, with true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to thy Soul. Wherefore let that Exhortation of the Apoſtle be an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to us; <hi>Follow Peace with all men, and Holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> O let the conſideration of the neceſſity of Holineſs ſtrengthen the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation upon our Spirits, ſo as to quicken us in our motion after the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, let us be exhorted to put on this Ornament of Holineſs upon the conſideration of the Excellency of it: the which is very great in ſeveral reſpects: firſt it is very beautiful in the ſight of God; it beareth his Image, and adorns the Soul with the likeneſs of himſelf; it beautifieth the Profeſſion of Truth, and filleth the Soul with Love both towards God and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men: yea thoſe excellent fruits of the Spirit, as Love, Joy, Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ce, Long-ſuffering, Goodneſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Temperance, againſt which there is no Law: What are they but effects of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152215:38" rendition="simple:additions"/> therefore let all perſons that make profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt be exhorted to worſhip the Lord in the Beauties of Holineſs.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſ.</hi> 110.3. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 96.9.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Holineſs is of great Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in reſpect of its Deſcent: it is of an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Birth: thoſe only are the perſons inveſted with it, that are born not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Fleſh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3, 5. It is the Church that is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in Chriſt Jeſus, and called to be Saints, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. and for the Church he gave himſelf, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of Water through the Word, that he might preſent it to himſelf a Glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that it ſhould be holy and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemiſh, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26, 27. Holineſs is therefore of great Excellency: as alſo the Excellency of Holineſs doth demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it ſelf by its Valuation; nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the precious Blood of Jeſus Chriſt could be a valuable price to purchaſe it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. yea thoſe excellent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that are in Charity muſt needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:152215:38" rendition="simple:additions"/> not eaſily provoked, thinketh no evil, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth not in iniquity, but rejoyceth in the truth; it may be ſaid, though I ſpeak with the tongues of Men and Angels, though I underſtand all Myſteries, though I beſtow all my Goods to feed the Poor, and give my Body to be burned, and have not Holineſs, it profiteth me nothing: O! therefore follow Peace with all men, and Holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Holineſs is of great Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in regard of the priviledges it brings to the Soul; it gives peace of Conſcience, and Comfort in a dying hour; it gives Boldneſs to appear before the great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal Seat of Juſtice, to behold the Face of the Judg with aſſurance of his Favour: when the great Men of the Earth, and the rich Men, and the chief Captains, and the mighty Men, and every Bond-man, and every Free-man, that is not adorned with Holineſs, ſhall call to the Rocks and Mountains, to hide them from the Face of him that ſitteth on the Throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6.15, 16. O! what would many a poor Soul give to be found in this Ornament of Holineſs, when Death ſhall ſummons him to the Grave, and this Conſideration is upon
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:152215:39" rendition="simple:additions"/> his Spirit, that the next thing he hath to do after Death, is, to ariſe and come too Judgment, when all his Riches, Honours, Pleaſures and delightful Vanities, carnal Friends and Companions in Iniquity, with all thoſe goodly things his Soul hath luſted after ſhall be turned into Gall and Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his Soul, and become his miſerable Comforters, to the greater horrour of his Conſcience, and the furtherance of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation? See <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.9. When tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and anguiſh ſhall be upon the Soul, then will the poor Soul bewail his former Folly, and careleſs Negligence, in ſlighting the Means of Grace, and the precious Price put into his hand, and he had not a heart to improve it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.16. and all thoſe things whereon his heart was fixed ſhall be diſſolved according as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: <hi>But the Day of the Lord will come as a Thief in the night, in the which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat; and the Earth alſo, and the works that are therein ſhall be burnt up: Seeing then that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſons ought we to be in all holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and Godlineſs?</hi> 2 Pet. 3.10, 11.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, let us conſider this Ornament of Holineſs in reſpect of the Duration of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:152215:39" rendition="simple:additions"/> it: Holineſs is an everlaſting Ornament unto the people of God: it becometh Gods Houſe for ever: It is the Wiſdom of the Children of this world, That when they want any Commodity, as Apparel, or otherwiſe, they will endeavour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it with theſe three conſiderations in their eye: firſt, where they may buy at the beſt hand, or cheapeſt rate: ſecondly, which Commodities are likely to be of longeſt continuance: thirdly, which are moſt beautiful and faſhionable.</p>
                     <p>Now let us caſt our eye upon this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of Holineſs, of which there is ſo much neceſſity, that without it no man ſhall ſee the Lord: and we may behold it tendred unto us at a very cheap rate, as on our part; for although Gold and Silver will not purchaſe it, yet God doth freely give it in the uſe of the means that he hath ordained to effect it. Let us then improve the means, and God hath promiſed a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. It will indeed coſt us the parting with our rotten rags of the Old man: but what are they in compariſon to the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the New man, which after God is created in Righteouſneſs and true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: it may be it will coſt us the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with our former Companions in worldly vanities: and not only our groſs
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:152215:40" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſins, but our own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. It may be it will coſt us the parting with a good Name among men, and with our Goods, Liberty and Life, which are things near and dear unto us: but if we part with all theſe for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, we ſhall be abundantly gainers by the hand: for what are corrupt Luſts and carnal Vanities in compariſon of the Gifts and Graces, and ſpiritual enjoyments of Chriſt? and what is the Fellowſhip of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Friends and vain Companions unto the Communion of God in Jeſus Chriſt, and the Fellowſhip of the Saints? and what are the Sufferings of Gods people, though in Name, Perſon and Eſtate, in compariſon of that exceeding and eternal weight of Glory promiſed unto a holy life? Holineſs doth far ſurpaſs all valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that can be laid in oppoſition to it: wherefore let us lay out for Holineſs; it is a rich bargain at the higheſt Rate.</p>
                     <p>Secondly; Holineſs is an Ornament ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding durable in reſpect of its Uſe and Service: the more it is made uſe of, the more excellent it is: Holineſs is every way ſerviceable to the Creature: it helps the Creature to glorifie God in obedience to his Commands, as to find acceptance with him: it helps towards peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:152215:40" rendition="simple:additions"/> and Comfort in a dying hour: it helps towards a ſanctified uſe of all the Creatures with comfort in the enjoyments of them: it helps a Soul to the ſight of God, and that bleſſed enjoyment of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him in Glory: Yea it is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable upon all accounts, at all times, in in all places, in all companies, &amp; in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: provided the Creature caſt it not off as a Garment out of faſhion &amp; eſteem; but put it on, and gird it to him, and be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways found in it, and it will be ſo ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him, that as aboveſaid, the more it is made uſe of, the more excellent it is. For,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Holineſs is never out of faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and eſteem with God and good men: it is that which God in Chriſt deſigned from Eternity, to accompliſh in his people; and Holineſs ſhall be the Ornament of the people of God unto Eternity: when all theſe outward things ſhall be diſſolved, holineſs ſhall remain in its primitive beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Holineſs accompanieth and beautifies a Soul not only in this life, but alſo in the life to come, as ſaith the Text; <hi>Holineſs becometh thine Houſe, O Lord, for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O let us be exhorted and moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by all theſe forementioned conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, to run the Race ſet before us;

                        <hi>to preſs after the Mark for the Price of the high Calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Phil. 3.14. <hi>to follow Peace with all men, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14.</p>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> with the means for the obtaining thereof is placed.</p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:152215:41"/>
                     <p>Secondly, the way in which a man muſt walk, and the manner how he muſt preſs on to the Center where Holineſs is cente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſo as to obtain the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, as Holineſs in its perfection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideth in God the Father: ſo Holineſs, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the means for the effecting the ſame, in the Children of Men, is, of the Father centered in God the Son, Jeſus Chriſt both God and man, and by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son, in its powerful influences and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations upon the inward man, is wrought and effected in them that are ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, and called to be Saints through the exerciſe of Faith in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now for the clearing up of theſe things to our underſtanding, let us conſider ſome Scripture-Teſtimonies. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of Jeſus Chriſt, hath theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions: <hi>For it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all Fulneſs dwell,</hi> Coll. 1.19. <hi>And in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily,</hi> Col. 2.9. Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>And the Word was made Fleſh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his Glory, the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as of the only begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth,</hi> Joh. 1.14. <hi>in whom are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledg,</hi> Col. 2.3. <hi>and of his Fulneſs
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:152215:42" rendition="simple:additions"/> have all we received, and Grace for Grace,</hi> Joh. 1.16. So that in Chriſt is centered both Holineſs and the means to produce Holineſs in the Sons and Daughters of men, unto whom he tenders Holineſs in the Goſpel, as <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt teaches, <hi>He came unto his own, and his own received him not; but as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God; even to them that believe on his Name,</hi> Joh: 1.11, 12. And hence it is, that God hath choſen his people in Chriſt, that they ſhould be holy, even becauſe the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Holineſs is inherently in Chriſt, with ſufficiency of the Spirit of Grace to effect Holineſs in his people through believing.</p>
                     <p>If then thou wouldſt preſs after Holineſs, ſo as to attain ſuch a degree thereof that thou mayſt have the comfortable ſight of God, and be enabled to ſtand before him with joy, then obſerve theſe enſuing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <note place="margin">The Eye fixed on Chriſt by Faith, is a great help towards the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Holineſs.</note>1. In all thy undertakings, look unto Jeſus, have an eye of faith fixed on him; he is the Center where Holineſs is centered: if we look ſhort of the Center, we are like to fall-ſhort of our purpoſe: let us therefore take the counſel of the Apoſtle; <hi>Let us run with patience the Race ſet before us, looking unto Jeſus, the Authour and Finiſher
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:152215:42" rendition="simple:additions"/> of our Faith, who, for the Joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the Throne of God,</hi> Heb. 2.1, 2. Yea, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we read the Word; pray, or perform any other Chriſtian Duty whatſoever, let us ſtill look to Jeſus, with deſire that we may have more Knowledg of him, more Faith in him, and more Love and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him: let us look unto Jeſus with an Eye of Faith fixed on him, and behold his performances on our behalf: let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his humility, who was very God, and yet, aſſuming the human Nature, became alſo Man; and taking upon him the form of a Servant, became obedient not only to the divine Precepts of his Fathers Law, but alſo unto Death, even the moſt ſhameful Death of the Croſs. O let us look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jeſus, and behold him in his Sufferings, and in the Cauſe and End of his Sufferings. The Cauſe of his Sufferings was our Sins, the End of his Sufferings was to free us from Divine Wrath due to us for Sin, and to obtain Eternal Salvation for us.</p>
                     <p>To look unto Jeſus, and with an Eye of Faith, to behold him as aforeſaid,<note place="margin">Gods way is a ſure and a ſafe way.</note> is to take Gods way to hearken to his Call and to obſerve his counſel, for our better attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto Holineſs and Heavens Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:152215:43"/> as ſaith the Lord by the Prophet <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah, Behold my Servant whom I uphold, mine Elect in whom my Soul delighteth, I have put my Spirit upon him, he ſhall bring forth Judgment to the Gentiles,</hi> Iſai. 42. <hi>I ſaid, behold me, behold me unto a Nation that was not called by my Name,</hi> Iſai. 65.1.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, let us not only look unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and behold him, but alſo conſider him; this is a piece of Divine Counſel:<note place="margin">A due Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Chriſts ſufferings a great help to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Holineſs.</note> alſo conſider the Apoſtle, and High-prieſt of our Profeſſion, Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1. O let us conſider the Greatneſs of his Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then in his Sufferings of Death; wherein he did not only ſuffer a natural Death, but alſo did bear the burthen and weight of Divine Wrath due to Mankind for Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion: the which being ſet home upon his precious Soul by the hand of Divine Juſtice, forced him into that Agony, that his Sweat was as if it were great Drops of Blood falling down to the ground; and to cry out,<note place="margin">Luk. 22.41. Matt. 27.46.</note> 
                        <hi>O my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> as if the ſenſe of Divine Wrath had ſo overwhelmed his precious Soul, that all the appehenſions of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Love had been ecclipſed from him.</p>
                     <p>One ſin ſet home to the Soul by the hand of Divine Juſtice is a heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then: how great then is the weight which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:152215:43"/> Chriſt underwent for us. <hi>Surely,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>he hath born our Griefs, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried our Sorrows, yet we did eſteem him ſtricken, ſmitten of God and afflicted: but he was wounded for our Tranſgreſſions; he was bruiſed for our Iniquities: the Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our peace was upon him, and with his Stripes we are healed: All we like Sheep have gone aſtray, we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the Iniquities of us all,</hi> Iſa. 53.4, 5, 6.</p>
                     <p>Certainly, if the Sons and Daughters of Men did but look through all their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, tranſitory and fading Felicities unto Jeſus Chriſt, with a ſerious conſideration of thoſe hard things he hath undergone, to procure Redemption for their poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Souls, it would more draw up and endear their Affections to the Lord, and produce in them a delightful endeavour to honour him in the way of Holineſs.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, as we ſhould look unto Jeſus, and conſider him in his great Undertakings for us: ſo ought we to conſider his Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs towards his Father, in reſpect of the Truſt he repoſed in him; and towards Man alſo in the proſecution of poor fallen Mans Redemption: Had he ſhrunk back in thoſe great and hard Undertakings, how had the Father loſt his Glory, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:152215:44"/> Man his true Felicity? but he, like a faithful and valiant Souldier, ſet his Face like a Flint<note n="*" place="margin">Iſai. 50.6, 7.</note> againſt all the oppoſitions the World and Devils could raiſe againſt him, until he had faithfully compleated his Undertakings to the Glory of his Father: ſo that he could boldly make up his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, ſaying, <hi>Father I have glorified thee on Earth, I have finiſhed the Work which thou gaveſt me to do. And now, O Father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the Glory which I had with thee before the World was,</hi> Joh. 17.4, 5.

Surely, if ever that Saying of <hi>Solomon</hi> in his <hi>Song of Songs</hi> be made good in any, it was abundantly manifeſted in Chriſts Love to Man: his Love indeed was ſtrong as Death; <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6. the many Waters of Affliction, nor Flouds of the Ungodly,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:152215:44"/> nor Death (the King of Terrors) could not be able to quench the Flames thereof: greater Love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his Life for his Friend: but ſo great was the Love of Chriſt to poor worthleſs Creatures, that while we were ungodly, and enemies to him, he died for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6, 8, 10. ſo that Redemption, Juſtification, Sanctification and Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are the effects of Divine Love; the which, if we could behold with a believing Eye, and ſeriouſly conſider, it would be an excellent means to raiſe up our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Love and Delight in the Lord, and to quicken us in our motions towards the Attainment of Holineſs: for every Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Chriſt in the days of his Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was ſo perfumed with Love towards us, that did we truely apprehend it, and really conſider it, it would be of force to draw our feet out of thoſe crooked paths of carnal vanities, and to place them in thoſe pleaſant paths where Peace with Holineſs doth dwell.</p>

Should I tranſgreſs the Kings Law in ſome high nature, whereby his Diſpleaſure is ſo provoked againſt me, that all that I can do cannot appeaſe his Wrath, nor ſtop the proceedings of Juſtice againſt me unto Death: in this ſad condition ſhould a Friend ariſe on my behalf, who is of near Relyance to the King, and in tender Love and Pity to me ſhould take my Caſe upon himſelf, and make an atonement for me, not only to the appeaſing of the Kings Wrath, but alſo to the procuring of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſo far, as not only to ſave my Life and Poſſeſſions forfeited, but alſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow me with ſuch Benefits and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges in his Kingdom, as far ſurpaſs all my former Enjoyments; yea farther, this

And indeed, while I exerciſe mine Eye upon this happy Object with a ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the excellent Benefits I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him, there is nothing more dear unto my Soul: but if I caſt mine eye &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations upon lower Objects, of leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, and ſhort of my Friend, I may ſoon forget his loving Kindneſs, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer my Love and Delight to grow dead to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him.</p>
                     <p>Surely, herein is our Condition repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; for we, unworthy Creatures, have tranſgeſſed not only a Law of an Earthly

                     <p>Now in this our ſad condition, which we are fallen into by reaſon of our Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, a Friend is riſen up on our behalf, even Jeſus Chriſt <hi>the Son of Righteouſneſs with Healing in his Wings,</hi> Mal. 4.2. who hath not only performed the Office of an High-Prieſt in the days of his Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>in offering his own Body</hi> upon the Croſs, to make an <hi>Atonement</hi> for us, and to free us from the Wrath to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10.

                     <p>It was the main Argument of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">When the Lord doth work the Love and Deſire of a Soul unto himſelf, it is a ſign that be intends to that Soul a farther Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he moved God, and ſtrengthened his own Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in him: <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thou wilt ordain Peace for us, (and why ſo?) for thou haſt wrought all our Works in us: other Lords beſides thee have had Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over us; but by thee only will we make mention of thy Name,</hi> Iſai. 26.12, 13.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſaid of a Souls coming to God in the Name of Chriſt, as aforeſaid, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid of his and the peoples Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to offer Proviſion for the building of the Temple: <hi>But who am I, and what is my People, that we ſhould be able to offer ſo willingly after this ſort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee,</hi> 2 Chron. 29.14. For ſuch a frame of Spirit doth flow from a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Work, wherein the Creature is

                     <p>Thirdly, a Chriſtian comes to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Name of Chriſt, not only upon the account of the Commands, nor only becauſe Chriſt, by Divine Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, hath wrought an earneſt Deſire in him after further Enjoyments; but alſo when he comes unto the Father upon the account of the Merits of Chriſt, making his Addreſs to this or the like effect, ſaying,</p>
                     <p>Moſt glorious God and merciful Father, in Jeſus Chriſt, although my Sins of Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Commiſſion (by which I have tranſgreſſed thy holy and juſt Law, and offended thy Majeſty) do render me not only unworthy of the leaſt of thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but alſo worthy of thy juſt Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to proceed againſt me; yet foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as thy only Son Jeſus Chriſt, in the proſecution of his Prophetick Office, hath revealed unto my Soul, that the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Riches of thy Grace and free Mercy to thy unworthy Creatures, is ſo aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that thou haſt given thy Son, who hath fulfilled thy Law by his actual Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereunto, to the end that I, thy

                     <p>Now therefore, moſt righteous Father, as thou haſt given unto thy poor Creature this new and living way unto the Throne of Grace, to approach thy preſence with free acceſs, I come unto thee utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing all my own Righteouſneſs, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not any ways meritorious or deſerving the leaſt of the Mercies which thy poor Creature doth enjoy, and caſting my whole dependency upon the Merits of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt my only High-prieſt, Mediator and Advocate for my acceptance with thee: I beſeech thee therefore, even upon the account of thine only Son, to grant me a free and full pardon of all my Sins, and to ſeal the aſſurance thereof unto my Soul, by that illuminating, quickening, ſealing and ſanctifying Spirit of Truth which proceedeth from thy bleſſed ſelf, and from thy Son, my bleſſed Saviour.

                     <p>Thus have I briefly delivered my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions concerning the Creatures go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God the Father by Prayer in the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt: wherein we may take notice of ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: as,</p>

                     <p>Secondly, how highly it doth concern e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Soul to have an Eye of Faith fixed on him, and conſider him with a due conſideration in all his Benefits.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, conſider that, as I am upon a

And, leſt any ſhould reply, Lord, we know not the Father, and how ſhall we come unto him? he annexeth this Promiſe alſo to the other, <hi>The time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> (meaning the time of his Exaltation) <hi>that I ſhall ſhew you plainly of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>

                     <p>Conſideration and Meditation are of great uſe in the way of Holineſs: <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> ſpeaking a word of Exhortation unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to fear the Lord, and ſerve him with all their heart; the more to engage them, and make his Exhortation prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with them, he puts them upon the act of Conſideration upon the great things

                     <p>And, doubtleſs, did we exerciſe our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations ſeriouſly upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his Offices; &amp; conſider how great things the Lord hath done and doth do for us thereby: did we conſider Gods End therein, with the uſe and Benefits thereof unto poor, fallen, enſlaved, ſinful man through believing; it would, through the Bleſſing of God, prove to be of an enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging nature, to engage us to preſs after the Attainment of Holineſs; and of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting nature, to direct us in the way; alſo of an incouraging nature, to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage againſt all difficulties lying in the way; and of a quickening nature, to quicken our motion towards the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of Holineſs in the Fear of God.<note place="margin">

                     <head type="sub">Containing ſome Directions tending to our better Attainment of that comely Ornament Holineſs, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on of Jeſus Chriſt; and abiding in him.</head>
                     <p>GReat Care and Coſt is exerciſed by many for the putting on upon the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, not only ſuch Raiment neceſſary for the Preſervation of its Health and Modeſty, but alſo for ſuch Attire that they think may moſt beautifie and adorn it to an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem in the Eyes of Men; mean while that Attire that is of greateſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the adorning of both Body and Soul, to make them comely and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the ſight of God, is laid by, diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, as Ornaments out of faſhion.</p>
                     <p>Holineſs is the comely Ornament, well becoming Gods Houſe, Gods People.</p>
                     <p>As I am upon a Uſe of Direction to the inquiring Soul for its Attainment to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:152215:67"/> and in the foregoing Chapters have laid ſome Directions before you, in order to that Attainment, by an Act or Exerciſe of the Eyes of the underſtanding Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon Jeſus Chriſt in his Offices, as King, Prieſt and Prophet, anointed and appointed thereunto by the Father.</p>
                     <p>Alſo an Act of Conſideration; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him in the proſecution of the ſaid Offices, with the Uſe, End and Tendency thereof towards the Sons of Men; as the Eye-Salve for the clearing the Eyes of the Underſtanding, to behold the way of Holineſs, and the Excellency of its At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments.</p>
                     <p>Now in further proſecution of this Uſe of Direction, I ſhall propoſe a further Action, in order to our perfecting Holineſs in the fear and way of God.</p>
                     <p>The which is, to put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Would we attain to an Eſtate in the Ornament of Holineſs: then our great concernment is, to put on the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. It is a piece of Divine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, not mine, but the Lords, given by his Spirit, whoſe Office it is to lead Souls into all truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But put ye on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 13.14.</p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:152215:67"/>
                     <p>Three things are here liable to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in way of Inquiſition, by the enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Soul: as firſt, wherein perſons are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, how perſons are concerned to put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, why perſons are concerned to put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in order to that Attainment of Holineſs.</p>
                     <p>To the firſt Propoſal, wherein Chriſt is to be put on: and that is in a threefold reſpect, in order to that Attainment:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, in reſpect to his Offices.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in reſpect to his Qualifications.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in reſpect to his VValkings.</p>
                     <p>To the ſecond Propoſal, how Chriſt is to be put on in reſpect to his Offices, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications and VValkings: And,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, to his Offices.</p>
                     <p>And that is, by an Act of Faith adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly and dependingly; as when a Soul beholding God the Father tendering his Son in all his Offices, as King Prieſt and Prophet, to the Soul: the Soul is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by moved to accept and take (by Faith) Jeſus Chriſt with all his Offices, ſo as wholly to confide in him, and depend on him, and on him alone, for a free pardon and a full Remiſſion of its ſins, and for its acceptation with the Father, through his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:152215:68"/> Atonement and Satisfaction made, by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Prieſtly Office.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, to confide in him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him, in order to his Kingly Office, as the only Lawgiver, unto whoſe Laws the Subjection and Obedience of the Creature is due, and ought to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and as its great Protector to eternal Bliſs.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, adheringly, by applying and relying, by confiding in him, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon him in his Doctrine, teaching Advice and Counſel contained in his VVord, as the only Rule and Guidance of a Soul into the paths of Holineſs and way of Salvation, by Vertue of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice Prophetical.</p>
                     <p>Thus to put on Chriſt, doth put a Soul into poſſeſſion of moſt excellent Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: as,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Chriſts Merits, obtained by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Prieſtly Office, doth become the Souls Righteouſneſs and Juſtification unto the Fathers Acceptation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly. Obedience to the Laws of Chriſt, as King, is attended with many Bleſſings from the Father, who accepts it as Honour done, as unto his Son, ſo alſo unto himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, by a Souls putting on of Chriſt
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:152215:68"/> as its Prophet: the Soul is put into poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a ſure word of Prophecy, an infallible Counſel for Direction how to ſtear its Courſe both in Word and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo as to pleaſe God, and to poſſeſs his favour, <hi>in whoſe favour is Life,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.5.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the ſecond thing propoſed, wherein perſons are concerned to put on Jeſus Chriſt, is in his Qualifications of Grace: It is not enough for perſons to hear the Word of Chriſt, nor to act in the viſible Ordinances of Chriſt; but alſo to endeavour ſo to improve the Word and Ordinances of Chriſt, by an Application of Chriſt in the ſame to the Heart through believing, that by the Power of the Word of Chriſt in our Hearts we may attain to the Qualifications of Chriſt, in their proper nature; ruling in our Hearts by the Dominion and Power thereof, to the enabling of us to ſubdue the Qualifications of Corruption, and to bring our Thoughts, Words and Actions, our Minds, our Wills and our Affections into a conformity unto Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And for Teſtimony hereunto, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are concerned to put on Chriſt in his Qualifications, and wherein theſe Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications do conſiſt, I ſhall call in two or
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:152215:69"/> three Scripture Evidences among many, which that infallible Spirit of Truth, proceeding from the Father and the Son, hath recorded, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1. <hi>If there be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Conſolation in Chriſt, if any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Love, if any Fellowſhip of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, if any Bowels and Mercies, fulfil ye my Joy, that ye be like minded, having the ſame Love, being of one accord, of one Mind: let nothing be done through Strife, or Vain-glory; but in lowlineſs of Mind: let each eſteem others better than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: let this Mind be in you, which was in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>See here is a Unity of Qualifications required between Chriſt and his People; the ſame Mind, the ſame affectionate Love, the ſame bowels of Compaſſion and Mercies, the ſame Humility, the ſame Patience in the Quality, though we cannot reach the Quantity.</p>
                     <p>To this purpoſe is that Divine Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Put on therefore, as the Elect of God, holy and beloved bowels of Mercies, Kindneſs, humbleneſs of Mind, long-ſuffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, even as Chriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave you, ſo alſo do ye; and above all things put on Charity, which is the Bond of Perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> as if he had ſaid, And above all things
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:152215:69" rendition="simple:additions"/> put on a real Love unto the Lord, and unto one another for the Lords ſake; and let all your Actions flow from that Original, and be therewith compounded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This is my Commandment</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples) <hi>that ye love one another, as I have loved you,</hi> Joh. 15.12.</p>
                     <p>O ſee Chriſt and Chriſtians Oneneſs in the matter of Qualifications, according to what Chriſtians do or ought to preſs after, in order to the Attainment of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Souls that would attain to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt put on Chriſt in his Offices, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in his Qualifications.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, as it is the great concernment of Souls, to put on Chriſt in his Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Offices, in order to Holineſs, ſo alſo in example of walking ſutable to thoſe Qualifications. It is not enough to receive Grace, and to have the Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Grace wrought in us; but there muſt be a bringing forth the Fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by a viſible motion and action in all thoſe ways wherein the Glory of God and the Benefit of his People is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, after the example of Chriſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our meaſure received.</p>
                     <p>Jeſus Chriſt in the days of his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was active to adminiſter Grace unto
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:152215:70" rendition="simple:additions"/> poor Sinners, for their Converſion, Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Salvation, according to what he had received of the Father: ſo Divine Counſel doth require every man, <hi>as he hath received the Gift, ſo to adminiſter the ſame one to another, as good Stewards of the manifold Graces of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.10. <hi>Edifie one another, as alſo ye do,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.11. <hi>building up your ſelves on your moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Faith,</hi> Jude 20. <hi>exhort one another,</hi> Heb. 3.13. <hi>admoniſh one another,</hi> Col. 3.16. forewarn and reprove in the caſe of Sin: Theſe are ſome of the footſteps of Chriſt, that he had his motion and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in; theſe are ſome of the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of the Flock of Chriſt, wherein they are by Divine appointment to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt in: and <hi>he that ſaith, he abideth in Chriſt, ought ſo to walk even as he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.6. It was commendable in the believing <hi>Romans,</hi> that they ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Word of Chriſt to an increaſe of Grace and Knowledg to an ability to admoniſh one another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.14. The <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> were under Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for their edifying and comforting one another in things of God, while the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> lay under Reproof, in that they, for the time that they had received the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ought to have been Teachers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:152215:70"/> they were become ſuch as had need to be taught again the firſt Principles of the Oracles of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Corinthians</hi> were commended for keeping the Ordinances to them delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but at the ſame time reproved for not obſerving of them in manner and form, according to the order of the firſt Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Delivery: therefore <hi>he that ſaith, he abideth in Chriſt, ought ſo to walk even as he walked:</hi> To this agreeth thoſe words of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, Be ye Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of me, even as I alſo am of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.1. even ſo, not otherwiſe, Chriſt muſt be the Pattern for Matter, Manner and Form; Chriſt walked in the obſervation of all the Laws and Ordinances in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Manner and Form, wherein his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Will, his Worſhip and Service was concerned; <hi>he that ſaith he abideth in him ought ſo to walk even as he walked.</hi> Should I by the way give one inſtance of Chriſts Obſervation in that holy Ordinance of Divine Inſtitution unto a holy Uſe and End, that in theſe days is by moſt people laid aſide, and by many violently oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and abuſed, calling it a low, carnal, empty thing, a Shadow without a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and a Shell without a Kernel, and the like, or worſe, and the Obſervers of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:152215:71" rendition="simple:additions"/> it had in gteat reproach; the which Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance is that Baptiſm where a Goſpel-Miniſter is the Adminiſtrator, and the Subject a Believer demonſtrating Faith in Chriſt, and much Water the Matter, and both going down into the Water, the Adminiſtrator dipping or overwhelming the Subject in the Water, in the Name of the Father, Son and holy Ghoſt, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and Form. This Baptiſm, as low as ſome would lay it, is from Heaven, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God the Father as a Branch of his Mind and VVill. To this Ordinance of Baptiſm in VVater did Chriſt the Son of God, and Head of his Church, ſubmit unto, in obedience to his Fathers VVill, as an act of Righteouſneſs, thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming it as the VVill of God, and an act of Righteouſneſs unto his People, for to obſerve and do in obedience to the will of God; the which Ordinance Chriſt hath ratified and confirmed unto his Church, and every Soul exerciſing Faith in him, by his Authority and Command, as a ſtanding Ordinance, to be obſerved in its place, and to its Ends &amp; Uſes, for and during the time of the Goſpel-Adminiſtration; the which is like to be until time ſhall be no longer, <hi>Revel.</hi> 10.6. or the great and terrible day of the Lord come, in which
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:152215:71" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Lord will judg all men, and thoſe living under the Diſpenſation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, according to their embracing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of his Counſel contained in the Goſpel: as it is written, <hi>The Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Angels in flaming Fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, from the preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power,</hi> 2 Theſſalon. 1.7, 8.</p>
                     <p>Therefore ſeeing the afore-recited Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was by God the Father inſtituted as a Branch of his VVill and an Act of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for Believers to obſerve and do; and Chriſt his Son hath confirmed it unto us by his perſonal Act therein, and alſo by his word of Command and Counſel thereunto: <hi>He that ſaith, he abideth in Chriſt, ought ſo to walk,</hi> ſo to obſerve the ſame, it being by Divine Authority made one of the footſteps of the Flock of God.</p>
                     <p>But here is one thing liable to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of the enquiring Soul, unto which I would ſay ſomething before I paſs this particular.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the End and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Baptiſm is an Appointment of God, to ſtand as a viſible ſign or token of his Covenant of Grace made in Chriſt for the Remiſſion of Sins, and Acceptation of Perſons, that through a ſupernatural Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination do ſee themſelves ſiinners &amp; loft by ſin, and their Redemption from the gift of Sin, and their Juſtification unto Life, to conſiſt in Chriſt, by vertue of his Death, Burial and Reſurrection, as a Propitita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Atonement by him made, unto his Fathers ſatisfaction, and acceptation, upon the conditions of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; that is to ſay, upon their embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of him believingly unto a dependency upon his Merits alone for their Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Sin unto Life, and Repentance unto a purpoſe of Heart to live to Chriſt in his Laws and Counſel contained in his VVord: and hence it is, that Baptiſm is ſometimes called <hi>the Baptiſm of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the Remiſſion of Sins:</hi> Luk. 3.3.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe by Gods Requirement it is to be attended with Repentance in the Subject unto a purpoſe of heart, to live to God, as contained in the Covenant.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe by Baptiſm God doth viſibly ſignifie both unto the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acting in Baptiſm, and alſo his Church, that he accepts that perſon unto a free
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:152215:72"/> Remiſſion of its Sins, and alſo to all his Church-Priviledges contained in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, becauſe a Believer in Baptiſm doth ſignifie both to God and Man its Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of Chriſt, and Repentance unto a purpoſe of Heart to live to Chriſt, by whom he receiveth the Atonement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Covenant.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, becauſe a Believer doth in Baptiſm reſemble Chriſt in his Death, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and Reſurrection, by which our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement was obtained: <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we are buried with him in Baptiſm into Death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up by the Glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of Life: for if we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his Death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſs of his Reſurrection; knowing this, that our Old Man is crucified with him, that the Body of Sin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve Sin,</hi> Rom. 6.4, 5, 6.</p>
                     <p>Whence note, that the Goſpel-Baptiſm is a Reſemblance of the Death, Burial and Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt unto Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: Chriſt deſcended down into Death and the Grave, taking upon him the weight and burthen of the Sins of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:152215:73"/> Men that went aſtray: a Believer deſcendeth (in Baptiſm) down into the Water, an Eliment of Death, where it gaineth power, and and is therein by the Adminiſtrator buried or overwhelmed, taking upon the Command and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt for its Rule thereunto; his Will for to obey, and taking upon him the Merits of Chriſt, whereby his Sins are done away.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt ariſeth out of the Grave by the Glory of God the Father, purpoſely to live unto the Glory of God the Father: but one thing here, among the reſt, I mind: He leaves his heavy burthen of Sin behind.</p>
                     <p>The Believer ariſeth up out of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as out of a Grave, by the Glory of God the Father's Grace, with purpoſe of heart to live unto the Glory of God the Father, through the power of Grace: and here one thing, as before, I mind: He leaveth all his former Sins behind, all done away by vertue of Chriſts Blood, by Faith applied in this ſimilitude.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And now</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ananias</hi> to <hi>Saul) why tarrieſt thou? ariſe, and be baptized: and waſh away thy Sins, calling on the Name of the Lord;</hi> Act. 22.16. not that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in it ſelf waſheth away Sin; but the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:152215:73"/> particular application of Chriſts Death, Burial and Reſurrection, with the Ends, Uſe and Efficacy thereof by Faith, as they are to the Eye of Faith repreſented by the Act of Baptiſm, with three Motions in the Water; as going down into the Water, buried in the Water, and ariſing up out of the Water, as aforeſaid: the which Baptiſm, with the form of Words thereto, is the Goſpel-Baptiſm, approved by the Divine Counſel of God, to be the viſible ſign and token of his Covenant made in Chriſt unto Believers, wherein God ſigns to them his Acceptation of them unto the Priviledges of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: they ſign to God their Acceptation of the Covenant, and Chriſt the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor thereof, to live to him according to his Mind and Will contained in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, and eight Souls therein, ſaved by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſaith, <hi>Like Figure whereunto even Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm doth now ſave us, not the putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the filth of the Fleſh, but the Anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two things are here laid down as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of <hi>Noahs</hi> Safety, the Ark and the Water: <hi>They get into the Ark, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:152215:74"/> the Water carrieth up the Ark above the deluge, to their preſervation:</hi> But we are principally concerned to look unto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Ground of their Preſervation, which was,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Gods Command and Counſel to <hi>Noah</hi> diſcovered.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Noahs</hi> Faith in embracing, and acting accordingly. <hi>Noah</hi> believes God makes Preparation, and gets into the Ark: and therefore <hi>Hebrews</hi> 11. attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes their Safety unto Gods Command and Counſel, and to <hi>Noahs</hi> Faith: <hi>By Faith</hi> Noah <hi>being warned of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Noah</hi> herein had the Anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God, he acted ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Will revealed, and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: <hi>Like Figure whereunto Baptiſm now ſaveth us,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter, not the waſhing away the filth of the Fleſh, but the Anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Three things are here conſiderable in theſe words of <hi>Peter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, Baptiſm is here ſaid to be of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nature.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, wherein it cometh ſo to be of a ſaving nature: and that is ſaid, to conſiſt in the Anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God.</p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:152215:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, how it cometh to be of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nature: and that is, by the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But why by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe that the Reſurrection of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is a ſure confirmation to us, that Jeſus Chriſt hath ſuffered Death, ſhed his Blood, for the obtaining a free and full Remiſſion of Sins unto a Juſtification from the Guilt thereof, and from the Condem- thereunto belonging, even to as many as believe on his Name.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt we have a ſure Confirmation,</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt we have ſure Confirmation, that he ever liveth to raiſe us up out of the

                     <p>Now, as it is the Counſel ond Require<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, that perſons ſhould through the Goſpel-Miniſtration, believe on Chriſt,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:152215:75"/> and conform to Chriſt, as aforeſaid; ſo alſo is it the Counſel and Requirement of God, that perſons ſo embracing of Chriſt by Faith, with purpoſe of heart to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to him, ſhould viſibly confeſs their Faith in Chriſt, and viſibly put on the Profeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt by Baptiſm, in the way of Chriſt, confirmed unto us in the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. the which Baptiſm, although with Water adminiſtred, doth unto the Eye of Faith comprehend figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively the Ark of Safety, with the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy Seat alſo <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, with the Covenant of Grace in him, which carrieth the Soul (through Faith) above the deluge of Sin and Condemnation for the ſame, wherein the ungodly world do ſink and periſh, while the Believer remaining in the Ark doth dwell in ſafety. Would you know the Reaſon why the Eunuch, when baptized, went away rejoycing? <hi>Act.</hi> 8.39.16.34.

                        <hi>Noah</hi> in believing Gods Word, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the Means by God appointed according to his Advice and Counſel, doth therein anſwer a good Conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; and anſwered his Conſcience with peace and ſecurity, to his great joy and conſolation: ſo a Believer in embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Gods Word, and improving it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Advice and Counſel, doth therein anſwer a good Conſcience towards God, and God doth in the ſaid Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment anſwer the Conſcience with peace, and the Soul with preſervation, to its great joy and conſolation.</p>
                     <p>A Believer by being baptized doth thereby viſibly juſtifie God in the truth of his Word, and God does by Baptiſm viſibly ſignifie his juſtifying of the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto a participation of all his Church-priviledges, according to his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>

                     <p>The Publicans, it ſeemeth, did apply the Word of God believingly: the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees and Lawyers gave not ſo much cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit thereunto.</p>

                     <p>Here behold a faithful Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:152215:77"/> God and Man, the Man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; he brings nothing to the Sons of Men, but what is the Mind and Will of God the Father, for them to believe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and do accordingly: and as Baptiſm is equally confirmed to us, with the reſt of Goſpel-Doctrine, for to be believed, and obſerved in its place: ſo it doth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern all perſons exerciſing Faith in Chriſt, to obſerve it ſo as to anſwer the Will of God, and a good Conſcience in the Adminiſtration and improvement of the ſame, in order to its End and Uſes: and withal conſider, that if it doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Shell without a Kernel to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it is for want of Faith in the Subject upon whom it is adminiſtred: to behold the Kernel, and to feed thereon: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is the Wiſdom and good Pleaſure of Almighty God to order the preaching of the Word unto all people, for to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Faith in them, and thoſe converted to the Faith unto a viſible Demonſtration of the ſame, to be meet Subjects for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and viſible Church-memberſhip by the ſame.</p>
                     <p>And whereas ſome perſons do pretend they are baptized with the Spirit, and therefore ſlight Baptiſm with Water, as too low an Ordinance for them to obſerve
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:152215:77" rendition="simple:additions"/> in the adminiſtration of it, and rather plead the ceſſation of it than the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
                     <p>In anſwer whereunto, conſider that if any perſons might have been exempted from Baptiſm upon that Plea, of being baptized with the Spirit: then doubtleſs, Chriſt, and alſo thoſe perſons ſpoken of <hi>Act.</hi> 10. might have been exempted, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they were extraordinarily inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Spirit and Gifts thereof: yet theſe muſt put on the Adminiſtration thereof, as an act of Righteouſneſs in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Will of God.</p>
                     <p>Whence note, that the higheſt Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Spirit and ſpiritual Gifts of Grace, we can attain unto in this Life, doth not exempt or free any perſon from, but rather obligeth the more unto, and maketh them the more meet for action in thoſe Ordinances of Baptiſm and Bread and Wine in their ſeveral places, ends and uſes.</p>
                     <p>And indeed it is a queſtion, whether thoſe perſons pretending the aboveſaid Plea, for their Omiſſion and Oppoſition of the afore-recited Ordinances, are at all pertakers of that Spirit whereunto they do pretend: foraſmuch as it is the Office of the Spirit of Truth to lead Souls into

                     <p>In the next place conſider, that although I have proceeded ſo far upon this point of Baptiſm, in order to the Vindication of it, and Believers in the Obſervation of the ſame: yet have I not digreſſed from the Matter of Direction to the enquiring Soul, in order to its Attainment to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: foraſmuch as Baptiſm, as before conſidered, is a holy Ordinance, inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the holy God unto holy ends and uſes; neither is it of the Matter of putting on of Chriſt, as before aſſerted, in order to the Attainment of Holineſs, but is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the ſame; that is to ſay, his Offices, Qualifications and Example of Walkings:</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Wherein he is to be put on.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. How he is to be put on: and</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Why he muſt be put on in order to that Attainment.</p>
                     <p>Having laid down ſomething to the firſt and ſecond, it remains that ſomething be ſaid to the third, Why Chriſt muſt be put on by thoſe that would attain to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? And,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe he is the Center in whom all the means appertaining to Holineſs is by the Father centered: <hi>In him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily, and ye are compleat in him,</hi> Coloſſ. 2.9, 10. Chriſts Perſon is holy, his Word is holy, his Works are Holy, his Name is holy, his Nature is holy, his Laws, Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Government, Councel; yea all in himſelf, and proceeding from himſelf is holy; he is the Fountain of Holineſs, full of the Springs of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Perſons muſt put on Chriſt in that Attainment; becauſe it is the Will of God, and his fore-determination and appointment from Eternity, that in Chriſt ſhould that Attainment of Holineſs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:152215:80" rendition="simple:additions"/> all perſons, through believing or putting on him as aforeſaid. There is no other way ſtanding in the Election or Counſel of God to attain unto Holineſs, but only in Jeſus Chriſt, as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he hath choſen us in him, before the Foundation of the World, that we ſhould be Holy and without blame before him in love,</hi> Epheſ. 1.4. Wherefore would we attain unto an Eſtate in the Ornament of Holineſs; would we have Chriſt formed in us, and we transformed into his like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo as to bare his Image, his Name and Nature? Would we anſwer God the Fathers Predeſtination, Election, and Calling? Would we have the aſſurance thereof ſealed unto our Souls, and have an entrance into his Kingdom? Then put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and abide in him as afore conſidered; in his Offices, Qualifications, and Example of walking; its the great deſign of God in Chriſt from Eternity; its the joy of every faithful Goſpel-Miniſter to behold ſuch effects wrought in a people; <hi>fulfil ye my joy</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that ye be like mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, having the ſame love.</hi> Its the Beauty of a Chriſtian; the very quinteſcence of Chriſtianity; the honour of Religion, to the glory of God.</p>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:152215:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>O put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in him, and make not proviſſion for the Fleſh, to fulfil the Luſts thereof.</p>

                     <p>Secondly: A word to the induſtrious Worldling.</p>
                     <p>O conſider ye, in whoſe hearts the world hath full poſſeſſion, that cannot ſpare one corner to give entertainment to the word of God by way of meditation and contemplation thereupon, although God requires the whole heart unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Conſider ye that are in an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate purſuit after this earthly treaſure: <hi>Take heed</hi> (ſaith our Saviour Chriſt) <hi>and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:152215:92"/> beware of Covetouſneſs, for a mans life conſiſteth not in the abundance of the things that he poſſeſſeth.</hi> Here me-thinks, I ſhould hear ſome ſay, that as to matter of Covetouſneſs, I think I am clear; for although I am induſtrious in my purſuit after the things of this world, yet I have not taken any thing from any man, but what I pay for; neither do I wrong any man, but pay every man his own; and therefore I think I am not guilty of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>But then the queſtion is, whether we can ſay as much in the caſe between our ſelves and God; and between us and our Souls; and between us and our Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? and firſt, Let us conſider a little as in the matters of God; have we not in our earneſt purſuit after our worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, ſpent the moſt part of that time that God hath required for his Service, upon our worldly intereſt? have not our minds and affections been exerciſed upon our worldly and carnal intereſts, when they ſhould be exerciſed by meditations and contemplations, with love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in God, his word and works, and celebrating praiſes unto his name? do we not by our earneſt purſuit after this worlds intereſt, make our bodies and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:152215:92"/> ſo dull, drowſy, and unfit for God's Service, that if we appear but one hour in a week therein, we ſpend the moſt part thereof in ſleep?</p>
                     <p>Do we not by our earneſt purſuit after this worlds intereſt, deprive our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of that Soul-Education that is due unto them from us by God's require<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
                     <p>Do we not by our earneſt purſuit after this worlds intereſt, with-hold more then is meet from the Poor and Needy, as in acts of Mercy, Charity, Pitty and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion by Gods commanded?</p>
                     <p>And if ſo, is it not Coveteouſneſs? yea, is it not Covetouſneſs which is Idolatry, when that our time, our ſtrength, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, conſiderations; our wills and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are ſo dedicated to the world, whereby God wants that Honour and Service that is due unto him; and our Souls want that nouriſhment that is of its greateſt concernment; and our Children want that Soul-Education that is their right and due from us to be performed to them; and the poor and needy eyes want that refreſhing, that of right by God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirement, and the bond of Nature, and the bond of Charity, we ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto them? <hi>There is that ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth</hi>
                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:152215:93" rendition="simple:additions"/> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) and yet increaſeth; and there is that with-holdeth more then is meet, but it tendeth to Poverty: The libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Soul ſhall be made fat, and he that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth, ſhall be watered alſo himſelf,</hi> Prov. 11.24, 25. <hi>The merciful man doth good to his own Soul, but he that is cruel troubleth his own fleſh,</hi> Prov. 11.17. The ſence of theſe words is made out, and confirmed by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 6.17, 18. <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor truſt in uncertain riches; but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate; laying up in ſtore for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold on Eternal life,</hi> verſe 19.</p>
                     <p>O conſider ye that have the world chief in your hearts, that ſins of Omiſſion are condemning ſins, as well as ſins of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. where you have a large deſcription of ſeveral under the ſentence of Condemnation, only charged with Omiſſions; as the fooliſh Virgins, for omitting the time and ſeaſon for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding themſelves of Oyle; and the ſloathful Servant, that improved not his
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:152215:93" rendition="simple:additions"/> Talent to the advantage of his Lord; and the hard-hearted, and cloſe-handed, that did not viſit, relieve, and ſhew mercy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the poor, diſtreſſed, and oppreſſed Members of Jeſus Chriſt. Wherefore conſider, and <hi>Sow to your ſelves in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, that you may Reap in Mercy, break up the fallow ground of your hearts, for it is time to ſeek the Lord, till he come and rain Righteouſneſs upon you,</hi> Hoſ. 10.12.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly: A word to the more knowing and ſeeming Religious; yet acting the qualifications of the Old Man.</p>
                     <p>Is Holineſs of ſuch concernment, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſidered; and the way of its At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment is by putting on of Chriſt in his offices, qualifications, and example of walking? It may adminiſter a word of Reprehenſion and Admonition unto thoſe of us in particular, and alſo all perſons that have attained a great meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Doctrin of Chriſt; yea, in the foundation-principles of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and yet do not perſevere to the putting on of Chriſt in his qualifications of grace, and example of walking, to the Crucifying of the qualifications of the Old Man. O how doth Pride abound in many knowing people, whoſe knowledge ſhould teach them humility? how many
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:152215:94"/> Profeſſors, even men of great knowledge, do ſuffer their deſires to run on in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate purſuit after the riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of this world, whoſe knowledge ſhould lead them to covet earneſtly the beſt gifts? O how is ſelf-love and ſelf-endedneſs abounding in this Generation, and that among knowing perſons, whoſe knowledge ſhould lead them to deny themſelves more in worldly things, to follow Chriſt in the way of holineſs; but as if thoſe words of <hi>Paul</hi> were made good in our days, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21. <hi>All ſeek their own, not the things of Jeſus Chriſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O how doth that old deformed qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Old Man, even Envy, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and Malice, ſhew it ſelf unmortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among many knowing people, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the denomination of Chriſtians, only upon the account of ſome differing opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, about ceremonial circumſtances; or it may be ſome difference in Judgment in the manner of Church-conſtitution, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Ordinances, or order of Diſcipline, to the expoſing one another unto the devouring jaws of Cruelty; by Impriſonment, loſs of Eſtate and Life, for not conforming the one to the other in an outward conformity, although in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſcience there is no union, as
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:152215:94" rendition="simple:additions"/> experience doth manifeſt in the dealings of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> with the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> one towards another in the caſe of non-conforming outwardly in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worſhip, in thoſe things that in judgment and conſcience they cannot act Faith in, as to be agreeable to the will of God; whereas, if Chriſtians in name would be Chriſtians in nature, and act one towards another in the qualifications of Chriſt; if difference in judgment ſhould cauſe a dividing in the matter of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in religious worſhip for conſcience-ſake; yet <hi>Ephraim</hi> need no more envy <hi>Judah,</hi> nor <hi>Judah</hi> vex <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but each enjoy his own priviledges and liberty of Conſcience in Religious Worſhip, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more hailing into Captivity, or complaining in our ſtreets, by reaſon of the tender Conſcience being oppreſſed?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But we are commanded to contend earneſtly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints; &amp; the more, becauſe of certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this Condemnation, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly men turning the grace of God into Laciviouſneſs, and deny the only Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Jude 1.4.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt: We are to conſider the perſons concerned in the duty, of contending, to be
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:152215:95" rendition="simple:additions"/> Chriſtians called into a Church Aſſembly in the faith and order of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>Secondly: For what they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and that is ſaid to be for the Faith once delivered to the Saints, or the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, and the obſervation thereof accordingly.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly: With whom they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; and thoſe are gain-ſayers of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt principles, and gain-ſayers of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt practices.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly: The manner of the mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this contention alſo is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that is two-fold, as 1. Reſpecting perſons without the Church, as not being Church-members: 2ly. Perſons within the Church, as Church-members. As to perſons without, there is no way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with them, to bring them into an imbracement of the Goſpel and Church-memberſhip thereby, but the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the word of God unto them, and the example of a Godly life; and if they will not be won thereby, there is no other forceable means upon Goſpel-record ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, that the Church of Chriſt ſhould by temporal penalties force them into Church-memberſhip, before, through Faith in Chriſt, they are made willing thereunto; for temporal penalties may
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:152215:95" rendition="simple:additions"/> force the body into a way of worſhip, but they cannot force the ſpirit; and God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth no ſuch worſhip, for <hi>the time is come</hi> (ſaith Chriſt,) <hi>that they that worſhip the Father, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth, for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him,</hi> Joh. 4.23, 24. And <hi>Paul</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerteth his remembrance of the believing <hi>Romans</hi> in his Prayers, with this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; <hi>God is my witneſs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whom I ſerve with my ſpirit in the Goſpel of his Son, that without ceaſing,</hi> &amp;c. Note here, <hi>Pauls</hi> Spirit and Goſpel-truth are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the worſhip of the Father; ſuch the Father ſeeks to worſhip him: Now Club-law cannot beat theſe two together, although laid on by human might and power. As ſaith the Lord concerning Chriſt, and his building of his Goſpel-Church under the denomination of his <hi>Zerubabel; not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.6, 7. Hereunto agreeth thoſe words of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.4. <hi>The Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of our warfare are not Carnal, but mighty through God, to the caſting down of ſtrong holds, caſting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into Captivity every thought to the obedience
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:152215:96"/> of Chriſt:</hi> the which weapons he doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explain, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Stand therefore, having your loyns girt about with Truth and the breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs, and your feet ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpel of peace, taking the ſhield of Faith, and the helmet of Salvation, and the ſword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, praying always with all prayer and ſupplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance.</hi> Theſe, and the like weapons, are the weapons of the holy Catholick Church, that believeth aright, and is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal in the truth, by which, they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their contention with thoſe that are without; and thoſe that withſtand that meanes, are to be left out of the Church in the world, during the pleaſure of the Almighty, and to be judged by that means they have rejected and condemned with the world, in the day that God ſhall judge the world by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But ſecondly: The text ſaith there are certain men crept in unawares, <hi>ungodly men, &amp;c.</hi> It ſeemeth that there were ſome in thoſe times, that by pretending Faith in Chriſt, were admitted into Church-memberſhip, which afterwards diſcovered themſelves by an ungodly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious life: Theſe it ſeemeth had no right
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:152215:96" rendition="simple:additions"/> unto Church-memberſhip, although a right to the hearing of the Word by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſt's Commiſſion, yet not unto Church-memberſhip; <hi>they crept in unawars:</hi> that is, their counterfeit Faith was not diſcerned, until afterwards that it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by error in opinion or practice.</p>
                     <p>But how muſt the Church contend for the Faith with theſe perſons, and carry on the management thereof?</p>
                     <p>Firſt: In a reſpective love to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, tendering the good of their ſouls, but with a hatred of their ſin; and in love to their ſouls, to reprove and admoniſh them; laying before them that part of Gods Law, againſt which the crime is acted; that thereby, they may the better be convinced and reforme, and ſo by the ſword of the ſpirit, the word of God, to deal with them, if poſſible, unto a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. But in caſe no Reformation doth appear, then to proceed in the ſeverity of Juſtice againſt them by Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to Chriſt's rule and order; and thereby caſt them out of the Church into the world again, as not to have any further priviledge in the Church then what the Lord affords the world, which is admittance to hear the Word for their Converſion. But what is the end of this
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:152215:97" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſeverity? There are divers ends; as firſt, To ſignify God's ſeverity againſt ſin and obſtinate ſinners, that as they are juſtly, for ſin, caſt out of Communion with his Church, and the gracious priviledges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto afforded here on Earth: So aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without timely Repentance unto a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, ſuch perſons are by God's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, and ſhall be by the ſentence of the juſt Judge of all the world,<note place="margin">See <hi>Math.</hi> 18.18.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from Communion with the Church triumphant, and all her glorious priviledges in her glorified ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Secondly: To the end, that the Sinner may conſider and ſee his ſin, be humbled for it,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20.</note> and aſhamed of it, and repent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a reformation, that the ſoul may be ſaved in the day of the Lord: ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly: To the end, the Church may preſerve her own purity and holy-ſtate, from being defiled with thoſe ſins, which if ſuffered, may get into other members and corrupt them, and it becometh a ſin unto the Church in her neglect of duty; ſee the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> chap. 5. the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> Rev. 2. all under reproof here upon the neglect of this duty.</p>
                     <p>Neither is the Church in general, nor the Officers thereof in particular, to make
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:152215:97"/> Edicts of their own deviſing, and enjoyn them as parts of God's worſhip, and to be obſerved, which are not Apoſtolically confirmed as to be the will of God, nor to Excommunicate any perſon for not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ſame, without defiling their holy ſtate with the guilt of ſin; for ſaith Chriſt unto thoſe perſons that ſtood ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in the Apoſtolical Obſervations, and received not the contrary, <hi>I will put upon you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>none other burthen, but that which ye have already; hold faſt till I come,</hi> Rev. 2.24, 25.</p>
                     <p>Whence note by the way; Firſt, That it is the will of Chriſt that his people ſhould obſerve that way of Church-conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, Doctrin, order of Worſhip and diſcipline, which was Apoſtolically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed without diminiſhing ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, until the ſecond coming of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly: That it is not the will of Chriſt that any Innovaſions or Additions to that order of Worſhip ſhould be brought in, or impoſed upon the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of his people, but that the Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, &amp; Obſervers, ſhall bear their ſin, and in retaining the Obſervations of the ſaid Innovations, do thereby ceaſe from being Catholick, or a people univerſal in the Truth.</p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:152215:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>But in caſe Innovations are brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, and maintained by the power of the Church, and impoſed upon the Members; and ſome of the Members cannot in Conſcience bear them, what way may they take to ſecure themſelves from the guilt of ſin, that attends the Church in the Obſervations of ſuch Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and not ſin againſt God? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, firſt: By contending againſt them, by the rule of truth, that if by any means the Church may be convinced of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and if this will not prevail, then to anſwer the call of God and his Counſel therein; which is, <hi>To come forth from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and be ſeparate, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you,</hi> ſaith the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the mideſt of her, be ye clean ye that bear the Veſſels of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 52.11. <hi>Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her Plagues,</hi> Rev. 18.4.</p>
                     <p>The which call of God, I do preſume was juſtifiable in <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and other Proteſtants, who for the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Innovations of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, did diſſent and ſeparate from her; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:152215:98" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhe was once a true Church of the Goſpel-Conſtitution and Order, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle giveth Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of them, calling them <hi>Beloved of God,</hi> and giveth thanks to God that their Faith was ſpoken of through-out the whole world, as in <hi>chap.</hi> 1.7, 8. <hi>And I my ſelf</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) alſo am perſwaded of you my Brethren, that ye alſo are full of goodneſs, filled with all knowledge, able al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to admoniſh one another,</hi> chap. 15. 14.</p>
                     <p>Yet notwithſtanding, in proceſs of time, ſhe hath much corrupted her ſelf by her own Edicts and Innovations, contrary to the rule of Truth, as to become a Miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, a <hi>Babel</hi> of Confuſion, rather than the Catholick Church of Jeſus Chriſt. And whereas ſhe doth contend with her diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by the temporal Sword, by Fire and Fagot, and Impriſonment, and the like, ſhe ſeemeth to ſit on the ſcarlet-coloured Beaſt, making her ſelf drunk with the blood of Saints, as it is written, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. The which way of contending, Jeſus Chriſt hath not allowed to his Church in all the diſpenſation of the Goſpel, that Tares (although Tares) ſhould be pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up out of the world, leſt they pluck up Wheat alſo. And if in caſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches that have caſt off the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:152215:99" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the Romiſh Church, and ſhall yet retain ſome of her Innovations and Ceremonial Circumſtances, or bring in and impoſe other of their own, which are not warranted by Goſpel-teſtimony, to be agreeable to the will of God, to the ſatisfying of tender Conſciences, and ſhall exerciſe the like power to force the ſaid Impoſitions upon the Conſcience in the matters of God's Worſhip; then, if any perſons ſhall in Love and Loyalty to the Lord, hearken to the call of God, and come forth and ſeparate, to the end they may ſet their feet in the holy ways of God, and worſhip him in his holy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, expoſing themſelves to the bearing of the Croſs for Jeſus ſake; then let the ſaid Proteſtant Churches blame themſelves, and not thoſe that ſeparate from them unto the aforeſaid end; for Chriſt's Sheep will hearken for the voyce of Chriſt to warrant their undertakings in the matters of their God; they muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth, for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him, wherefore <hi>worſhip the Lord in the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of holineſs,</hi> according to the pattern in the Mount, or that which is Apoſtolically ſet forth unto us: wherefore, according to the exhortation given by the Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:152215:99" rendition="simple:additions"/> Let us every one lay aſide all Malice, Guile, Hypocriſies, Envyings, and Evil ſpeakings; and as new-born Babes deſire the Milk of the Mothers breaſt, and feed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for its natural nouriſhment:</hi> So let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of us deſire the ſincere Milk of God's Word, ſo as to feed thereon for our ſpiritual nouriſhment and growth in the knowledge of Chriſt, and qualifications of grace, till we have Chriſt formed in us, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. And we conformed to his Image in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and true Holineſs, according to the ſore-Predeſtination or Appointment of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. That when he ſhall come as a Bridegroom, to receive his Spouſe unto himſelf, and to ſettle her in his Heavenly Manſions, which he is now preparing for her, we being found in thoſe Wedding Robes, may be accepted of him, and received by him into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him to the participation of his choyceſt Loves, in that inheritance which ſadeth not away; and in the mean time, let us (as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith) follow after thoſe things that make for peace, and things whereby one may Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy another; and as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let all your things be done in Charity,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.14. <hi>For although</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>I
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:152215:100" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſpeak with the tongues of Men and Angels, and have all the gifts of Prophecy; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all Myſteries, and all Knowledge, and all Faith to remove Mountains; give all my Goods to feed the Poor, and my Body to be burned, and have not Charity, it profits me nothing,</hi> Cor. 13.1, 2, 3.</p>
                     <p>Knowledge and gifts not ſanctified with the qualifications of the graces of Chriſt, <hi>puffeth up</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1. <hi>But Charity edifieth, Love worketh no ill to his Neighbor, therefore Love is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law,</hi> Rom. 13.10. Surely if this grace of Love in Jeſus Chriſt was ſo rooted and grounded in our hearts, as to become the qualification in us, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from whence our words and actions both towards God and men did proceed, how would peace and unity adorn our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, and holineſs ſhew forth it ſelf to the praiſe and glory of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? how would our knowledge, gifts, and all enjoyments be ſanctified to us in the uſe thereof; and Envy, Strife, and Contention diſſolve and fly away? But I muſt haſten to another Uſe that my Doctrin leads me to, and that is a Uſe by way of caution unto the Saints, or thoſe that have attained unto a good degree in the <hi>Ornament of Holineſs.</hi>

                     <p>IT is a common thing among moſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that when they have caſt off their old Garments, and put on new that are comely and faſhionable, credible, and profitable, to be very careful and cautious, and take great heed of them leſt they ſhould be defaced with ſpots and ſtains of pollution; and it is Wiſdom ſo to do, and a point of prudence; and if the Children of this world are ſo wiſe in their Generation, for the preſerving of their temporal concerns, how much more are the Children of God concerned to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe much wiſdom and prudence, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very cautious (with great heed and care) that their credible, faſhionable, and comely Ornament of Holineſs be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the ſtains and pollutions of ſin?
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:152215:101"/> All ſin is of a defiling nature, and doth much ſtain and pollute the Soul, together with its Ornaments of Holineſs and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, whereunto it hath attained, and eſpecially when they are committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Knowledge and Grace received, as the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> chap. 4.8. <hi>How be it then, when ye knew not God, ye did ſervice to them that were no Gods; but now after ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain?</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:152215:102"/> ſin; becauſe as it is of a defiling nature, ſo is it alſo of a depriving nature: Sin in God's people, many times deprives them of many comfortable enjoyments, which otherwiſe they might happily enjoy: Sin depriveth Angels of their Heaven, Man of his Paradice, <hi>Iſrael</hi> of his <hi>Canaan,</hi> and many a poor ſoul of the manifeſtation of God's favour, both in temporal and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual enjoyments, as is evidenced by the word of the Lord in many Teſtimonies: whereof let us conſider one teſtimony, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord concerning</hi> Iſrael, <hi>I remember thee, the kindneſs of thy Youth, the love of thine Eſpouſals, when thou wenteſt after me in the Wilderneſs, in a Land that was not ſown.</hi> Iſrael <hi>was Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to the Lord, and the firſt-fruits of his increaſe; all that devour him ſhall offend, evil ſhall come upon them ſaith the Lord.</hi> In which words the Lord puts them in mind of their former kindneſs and love unto him, and their walking with him in that their former ſtate, then <hi>Iſrael was holineſs unto the Lord;</hi> and yet in the next verſes, the Lord is taking up this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt them; <hi>What Iniquity have your Fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after Vanity, and become vain;</hi> and in chap. 5. he ſaith,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:152215:102"/> 
                        <hi>Your ſins have with-holden good things from you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From which words we may note four particulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt: That God's people are very apt to decline from their firſt degree of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, obtained in their firſt Illuminations and Experiences of God. They were holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Lord in their firſt Eſpouſals, but now become vain, and gone from God; the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was eminent for God, but now fallen from her firſt love, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>Secondly: Note, that the people of God are uſually moſt holy, and walk moſt cloſe with God, when they have but little of theſe outward things to depend upon: <hi>When thou wenteſt after me in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in a Land that was not ſown, then</hi> Iſrael <hi>was Holineſs to the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly: Note, that the more cloſe God's people keep to him in the way of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the ſooner ſhall their Adverſaries in their enterpriſes be defeated: <hi>All that devour him ſhall offend; evil ſhall come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them,</hi> ſaith the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly: Note, that God's people declining the way of Holineſs, deprive themſelves of comforts very great, and not their Enemies, but themſelves do oft
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:152215:103"/> thereby defeat, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.3. Iſrael <hi>hath caſt off the thing that is good, the Enemy ſhall purſue him.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>But Thirdly, by way of Caution.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As God's people are greatly concerned to take heed, and be very cautious of medling with ſin, becauſe it is of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing nature, and alſo of a depriving na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo is it alſo of a deſtroying nature: Sin ſuffered in the Creature, and not waſhed out by true Repentance and rich Mercy as aforeſaid, and eſpecially when entertained with delight: O how will it not only ſtain our Ornaments of Grace and Holineſs, but alſo eat up and deſtroy by degrees, like the Moth in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Worm in the Nut, the very life, marrow, and quinteſcence of Chriſtianity or power of Godlineſs; even that love, zeal, reality, and ſincerity of heart, with all thoſe gifts and ſpiritual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments and enjoyments formerly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, until there be nothing left but an out-ſide form of Godlineſs, if that; ſo that the Creature becometh as to ſpiritual performances, and acts of grace in the life and power thereof, but like unto a man whoſe ſoul is departing, or departed, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle left but an out-ſide Carkaſs; and if a

To this doth the Eſtate of the Churches of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Laodicea</hi> witneſs, as alſo many other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents in holy Scripture; the which, to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:152215:104"/> run over ſo large a field, my preſent time and occaſions will not permit; wherefore let us be very cautious how we meddle with it, but watch againſt it, take heed and be ware of it, and the occaſions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whether they be ſins of Omiſſion or Commiſſion; all ſins are of a deſtructive nature, and eſpecially ſins againſt Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Grace received, being allowed and approved of, or winked and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at: How plentifully doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſet forth the deſtructive nature of ſin, and particularly thoſe Grandees, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, Hypocriſy, Hereſy, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Gluttony, prophane Swearing, and Blaſphemy, Whoredom and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Coveteouſneſs and Idolatry, Pride, Preſumption, and Oppreſſion, and the like: The which ſins are (with many other) not only deſtructive to ſoul and body, gifts and graces, but alſo unto Families and Church-fellowſhips, Cityes and Countrys, Kings and Kingdoms, as the Scriptures do plentifully evince, as ſaith the Lord by <hi>Samuel,</hi> chap. 12.25. <hi>But if ye ſhall ſtill do wickedly, ye ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, both you and your King;</hi> in which words are intimated as to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo to us; that if a people do live in ſuch a wicked vicious life, as highly to provoke God's
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:152215:104"/> Juſtice againſt them, that then God would conſume them with ſuch Judgments, as they, nor their King ſhould be able to withſtand.</p>
                     <p>Whence note by the way, that men of a wicked vicious Converſation, thereby endeavour ruine to their King &amp; Nation; concerned therefore is the Kings Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for to ſuppreſs ſuch wickedneſs and grand impiety.</p>
                     <p>Secondly: Note by the way, that men in whom is civil honeſty, and Godly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, are the beſt Subjects; for whoſe ſake many times the tranquility of a City or Nation is prolonged; wherefore all ye that have any reſpect unto your Native Country, King and Kingdom, or unto your own ſouls, and yet are ſolacing your ſelves in wicked vicious ways, let <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> Counſel find acceptation with you, <hi>To break off your Sins by Righteouſneſs, and your Iniquities by ſhewing Mercy to the Poor, if it may be a lengthening of your own tranquility, and of your Country, King and Kingdom,</hi> Dan. 4.27.</p>
                     <p>And all ye that are Deſcipled to Chriſt, and by confeſſion of Faith and Baptiſme, have joyned your ſelves into a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional way of Church-communion, to live to Chriſt, and to walk with him in all his
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:152215:105"/> holy appointments contained in his word; remember Chriſt's Counſel by way of caution to you: <hi>Take heed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your ſelves, that your hearts be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with Surfeting and Drunkenneſs, and cares of this life, and ſo that day come upon you unawares; for as a ſnare ſhall it come upon all them that dwell upon the face of the whole Earth: Watch ye therefore and pray always, that ye may be accounted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to eſcape all theſe things, and to ſtand before the Son of man,</hi> Luk. 21.34, 35, 36. O conſider, the Caution is a piece of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Counſel, <hi>take heed therefore:</hi> And as Surfetting and Drunkenneſs is become a part of the abounding ſins of this Age and Nation, and many temptations and opportunities thereunto are preſented, and many evils thereby doth enſue; take heed therefore, watch and pray againſt the temptations, occaſions, and evils thereof; and conſider, that as Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs diſmables and makes a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet for divine Contemplations and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Services, ſo alſo the immoderate cares of this life makes perſons unfit and unmeet for the ſame, and alſo unmeet for the enjoyments of glory: <hi>Therefore take heed, and beware, watch and pray</hi> againſt the ſame; alſo conſider what diſhonour
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:152215:105"/> it is to God, what reproach to religious profeſſion, what grief to the ſpirit and ſpiritual perſons, and wounds to your own Souls attend thereupon: Take heed therefore, watch and pray always, that ye may eſcape theſe things; once again conſider, that unto you that are Chriſtians by profeſſion, theſe ſins are ſins againſt divine Love, Light, and Knowledge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; ſins againſt rich grace, ſins of a deep defilement, ſins againſt Covenant-mercies and obligations, which if after we have eſcaped ſuch corruptions through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Illuminations and Experiences of God in Heavenly concernments, and ſhall again therewith be entangled and brought in bondage, may not the laſt ſtate be worſe then the firſt? <hi>Therefore take heed, watch and pray,</hi> that ye may be able to withſtand all temptations, and to ſtand before the Son of man. If our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> in their eſtate of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, did, by yielding unto one temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation againſt the known Law of God, ſo corrupt themſelves and Poſterity, as to ſtain and pollute their Ornaments of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Righteouſneſs, and thereby diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves to withſtand many other temptations without a divine aſſiſtance; how do we know, but we, by yielding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:152215:106"/> one temptation, to tranſgreſs allowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Law of God known unto us, may thereby diſable our ſelves to withſtand Satan in many other of his wiles? one ſin may give advantage to another; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>take heed, watch and pray</hi> for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine aſſiſtance, that ye fall not in tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and as we are to take heed of vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of life, ſo alſo of corruptneſs of judgment in the points of Faith by falſe Doctrines, which are likewiſe ſome of Satans baits and ſubtil wiles, wherewith he lyeth in wait to deceive; <hi>take heed therefore, watch and pray</hi> againſt the ſame, try before ye truſt, and prove them by the word of Chriſt before ye imbrace; <hi>If any bring not the Doctrin of Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him not into your houſe, neither bid him Godſpeed, for he that bideth him God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeed, is partaker of his evil deeds:</hi> As ſaith Saint <hi>John</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, 10, 11. <hi>Take heed</hi> (ſaith Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) <hi>for many ſhall come in my name, and ſhall deceive many:</hi> Take heed therefore, watch and pray, that ye may obtain a firm Faith in Chriſt, and a well-grounded judgment in his Counſel, contained in his Word, his Teſtimonies, Commands and Promiſes to the enabling of you to live therein, and according thereunto, to the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:152215:106"/> perfecting holineſs in the fear of God. Plentiful is the Scripture of Cautions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account, whereunto I ſhall refer you, and proceed unto a further proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Uſe by way of Caution, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that omiſſion of Duties required, is ſin of dangerous conſequence as well as actual tranſgreſſion. Take heed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of neglect of duty, and particularly the omiſſion of action in the Word of God and Prayer: The Word or Doctrin of Chriſt is ſomtimes called the word of Faith, becauſe it is the ordinary means in the miniſtration of it to beget Faith, and to nouriſh Faith, and to compleat Faith in a Soul towards Jeſus Chriſt: It is ſomtimes ſaid to be <hi>the power of God to Salvation unto every one that believeth;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the tendancy, uſe, and efficacy of it, is to the directing, leading, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of Souls up to the attainments of Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt: And as it is the requirement of God, that the Sons and Daughters of men ſhould harken dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently unto his Word in the miniſtrations of it, and to meditate therein, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it, and improve it to the glory of his Name, and to their attainments unto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and happineſs, ſo it becomes a duty incumbent upon us to be active therein;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:152215:107"/> 
                        <hi>Therefore take heed and beware</hi> of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in this great duty, and our omiſſion thereof become our great ſin, and the Word that we have omitted, become a witneſs againſt us to our Condemnation: And let thoſe that through grace have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived miniſterial gifts, and imployed in the work of the Miniſtery, take heed of omitting willingly or careleſly what the Lord requires at their hands in order to their feeding of the Flock of God; take heed therefore of omitting, but watch and pray for opportunities to the work, and for divine aſſiſtance in the work, that ye ſtain not your Ornaments of Holineſs by the ſin of Omiſſion.</p>
                     <p>And in the duty of Prayer, take heed of Omiſſion, leſt it become ſin unto us; <hi>God forbid</hi> (ſaith <hi>Samuel) that I ſhould ſin againſt the Lord in ceaſing to pray for you,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.23. God's People are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to pray for an increaſe of Labourers in the work of the Miniſtery, and for an increaſe of gifts and qualifications ſutable to the work in thoſe that are already im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed: And if <hi>Paul</hi> did ſtand in need of, and required the Prayers of God's People, who was extraordinarily gifted; how much more ordinary gifted-Miniſters? <hi>Paul</hi> required the Prayers of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:152215:107"/> in order to his preſervation from the hands of wicked and unreaſonable men: And herein Chriſtians ought to be active at the Throne of grace in behalf of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Miniſters now, and eſpecially when the ſtorms of Perſecution ariſe againſt them.</p>
                     <p>Chriſtians are required to pray for the civil Magiſtrate, for Kings, and all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all Godlineſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, for this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour. The Office of Magiſtracy is an Ordinance of God, appointed to execute Juſtice againſt evil doers; but for the praiſes and protection of them that do well; the Office is weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of great concernment, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not only humain Wiſdom and Counſel, but divine alſo, to the well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement thereof; therefore it is of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment that God be ſought unto, both by the Magiſtrate, and alſo by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects on the Magiſtrates behalf, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine aſſiſtance in Wiſdom, Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Faithfulneſs of heart; for the well management of the civil Laws, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of God, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Name, and the Subjects privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: Wherefore, as Goſpel-injunction
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:152215:108"/> doth require the duty, take heed of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the ſame, leſt it become a ſin, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing and ſtaining the Ornament of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in your attainments thereof.</p>
                     <p>Alſo, conſider that this duty of Prayer is extended as the duty of every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, not only for themſelves, but alſo for one another, and for Enemies and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors: Therefore take heed, omit not the duty, leſt it become ſin unto us of a deep pollution; <hi>Continue in Prayer, and watch thereunto with thanksgiving,</hi> Col. 4.2. <hi>Note,</hi> Here is a further duty to be joyned with Prayer, for Chriſtians to be active in, and that is Thanks-giving: All our enjoyments are ſaid to be ſanctified to us by the Word of God and Prayer, and are to be received with thanks-giving. <hi>He that offereth praiſe, glorifieth me,</hi> ſaith the Lord: Praiſes and thanks-giving to God, is a Heavenly exerciſe, a work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirable here in the Kingdom of grace, and more perfectly performed in the Kingdom of glory by Saints and Angels in their glorified ſtate. God that hath bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in Chriſt Jeſus, is worthy of all praiſe and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to the glory of his Name; from him we receive all our ſpiritual and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral enjoyments, and unto him belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:152215:108" rendition="simple:additions"/> praiſe and thankſgiving to the glory of his Name: Every mercy enjoyed, calls for a return of praiſe to the Lord, from whom it doth proceed: Therefore let us be careful here, take heed of omitting this great duty, leſt we be found deep in ſin, and our Ornaments of Holineſs be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: Ten Leapers were cleanſed by Chriſt, but where are the nine? only one return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to praiſe the Lord.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take heed therefore, watch and pray,</hi> that you may be ſenſible of God's mercies afforded, and not forgetful of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns: I cannot here ſtand to number up the mercies afforded to us, they are great and large; yet here is one among the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny I would ſay ſomthing to.</p>
                     <p>It is not long, ſince a ſtrong, rough, Eaſt wind did blow upon us for ſeveral years; it may be the Lord had a good end in it, as to ſift us, to prove and try the reality of our hearts towards him in our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, to blow away the Chaff, but to preſerve the Wheat; ſo that although tryed, yet the Lord in meaſure did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with it; ſo that although under the left hand of affliction, yet upholden by a right hand of mercy: So that as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>We were troubled on every ſide, yet not diſtreſſed; Perſecuted, but not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:152215:109" rendition="simple:additions"/> caſt down, but not deſtroyed.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are we to behold God's hand with much thankfulneſs, and to take heed that we forget not his Providences, under which rough diſpenſation, we may remember that we did ſet ſeveral days apart to ſeek the Lord by Faſting &amp; Prayer, laying our condition &amp; cauſe before him: And for as much as it hath pleaſed the Lord ſuddenly to turn back the rough ſtormy wind, and to bring a calmy Southern ſerene refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gale upon us, in ſuch a way as was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected by us, although our hope in him was for a deliverance in his time, and which way ſhould ſeem good unto himſelf, for the glory of his name; and indeed, as the Lord is admirable in all his works and ways, ſo in this; that by the ſame hand he did chaſtiſe us, by the ſame hand he ſhould deliver us: as if the Lord was minded to ſeal the truth of thoſe words of <hi>Solomon</hi> unto us; that, <hi>the Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord; as the rivers of water he turneth it whither ſoever he will,</hi> Prov. 21.1. O who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller; did we think ſuch a thing, or did our Proſecutors expect it? may not we herein ſay with the Pſalmiſt? <hi>When the Lord turned again the Captivity of</hi> Zion,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:152215:109" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                        <hi>we were like them that dream:</hi> Rather queſtion whether it was a real thing, or a fained, then readily to believe it.</p>
                     <p>But for-as-much as it hath pleaſed God thus admirably to anſwer our poor Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons put up unto him in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, beyond our deſervings or expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; let us in theſe enſuing particulars be very cautious, and take heed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware.</p>
                     <p>Firſt: That we do not omit the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of this our deliverances to the Lord, to the glory of his Name, as the original Author thereof, and to the King as an inſtrument in his hand, leſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion hereof become ſin unto us, and a ſtain unto our holy Atchievments; but rather with <hi>Ezra,</hi> ſay, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord, that hath put ſuch a thing as this in the Kings heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly: That we be very cautious, and take great heed, and beware of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting our duty in a return of praiſes ſutable to the benefits we receive by the Lords anſwering us in our requeſts unto him. O let it not be ſaid of us as once of <hi>Hezekiah; But he rendered not again, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Benefit done unto him,</hi> 2 Chro. 32.25. And of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that when he ſlew them, <hi>Then they ſought him, and enquired
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:152215:110" rendition="simple:additions"/> early after God, and they remembred that God was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer,</hi> Pſal. 78.34, 35. <hi>but they ſoon forgot his works, they waited not for his Counſel,</hi> Pſal. 106.13. But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo apply and improve his benefits herein, as to make them the greater ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to us to love the Lord, to truſt in him, and to wait upon him in his holy appointments as long as we live, as ſaith the Pſalmiſt; <hi>I love the Lord, becauſe he hath heard my voyce and my ſupplication; becauſe he hath enclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live,</hi> Pſal. 116.1, 2.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly: Let us be very cautious, and take heed unto our ſelves, and beware, that by Carnal ſecurity we abuſe not our liberty and priviledge of proſperity by acts of vanity, and neglect of our duties in true Chriſtianity, and ſo make our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of liberty and proſperity to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of greater damage to us than ten or twelve years of Perſecution hath ever yet done; for as much as we ſhall ſin under the greater Mercies, and ſo muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the greater Judgments from the Lord: There is, in a day of Proſperity, more danger of a peoples growing into Carnal Security, and forgetting of their
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:152215:110"/> God, than in a day of affliction, if we take not heed; as the Lord ſaid to <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, <hi>When ye ſhall come into the good Land, and have Houſes builded, and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and Olives planted, and your Cattel multiplyed, and ye have eaten and are full; then beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, in not keeping his Commandements, and Judgments, and Statutes, which I Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee this day, that then thou forget not the Lord thy God that brought thee out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>out of the Houſe of Bondage,</hi> Deut. 6.12.</p>
                     <p>Whence <hi>note,</hi> that God's People that have had great experiences of God, are in times of peace and plenty very apt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Lord, and to turn aſide from a due obſervation of his ways, and thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file themſelves with the ſins of ingratitude, and great diſobedience under eminent mercies, highly provoking the Lord: would we be a holy people unto the Lord? Let <hi>Iſraels</hi> and others ſins, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the ſame, make us timely to beware leſt we ſtain our chiefeſt Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereby, and watch and pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch ingratitude; the neglect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, may cauſe God to neglect us of thoſe ſupplyes of grace neceſſary to uphold us; and in all our approaches to the Lord, we
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:152215:111"/> are alſo to take heed, and be careful that our end be right; that we might glorify God in our act of Prayer, and our end of asking any thing of God, may be for our better glorifying of his Name; the end many times crowns the action; as the words of Saint <hi>James</hi> doth imply; <hi>Ye have not, becauſe ye ask not; and ye ask, and have not, becauſe ye ask amiſs, that ye may conſume it upon your Luſts,</hi> Jam. 4.2, 3. Wherefore would we have God to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and ſupport us, let us not omit our duty in ſeeking to him; would we have him anſwer us in our ſeeking to him? then let us take heed that we omit not a right end in what we ſeek unto him for.</p>
                     <p>The omiſſion of one thing more I would preſent, to mind, that we take heed of (leſt it ſhould become ſin unto us), and that is, of omitting the miniſtring of our temporal things unto ſuch as perform the Office of miniſtring unto us in ſpiritual things, eſpecially if it be by the Miniſter required; for as much as the Lord hath ſo required and ordained that they that Preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel: The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> would have the Churches know their duty in this point, and the Miniſters power to require it, although he voluntarily would rather
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:152215:111" rendition="simple:additions"/> work with his hands, then to be chargable to the Churches: But as for me, as I have not been chargable hitherto in that nature, for what hath by me been done upon that account, ſo do I not deſire to make the Goſpel chargable to any, except the greater neceſſity; yet as <hi>Paul</hi> would, ſo would I have Chriſtians know their concernment in this point, as well as other points of Chriſtianity, and to take heed, leſt Omiſſion here do not become a ſin of deep pollution, ſince it is doubtleſs the requirement of God: ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> cap. 9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. And let the Miniſter on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand take heed, and beware, that he make not temporal means and honour the chiefeſt end and maſter-wheel of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the work of the Miniſtry, and it become a pollution of the Ornaments of holineſs unto him.</p>
                     <p>Alſo take heed and beware of omitting actions of charity towards the poor, and it become our ſin; <hi>For as much</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>as ye have not done it to one of the leaſt of theſe my Brethren, ye have not done it unto me; go ye therefore into everlaſting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels; but he that giveth to the Poor, lendeth to the Lord, and he will repay it: Bleſſed is the man that conſidereth the Poor, the Lord
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:152215:112"/> will deliver him in the time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſo I ſhall conclude this Uſe by way of Caution, with thoſe words of <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Only take heed to thy ſelf, and keep thy Soul diligently, leſt thou forget the things that thine eyes have ſeen, and leſt they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from thy heart all the days of thy life; but teach them thy Sons, and thy Sons Sons.</hi>

                     <p>A ſecond ground of encouragement in the proſecution of this deſign, may ariſe upon the conſideration of the promiſe of aſſiſtance in the management of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for holineſs, made to the proſecutors of the ſaid deſign.</p>
                     <p>A man having a deſign for his advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this world, either for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome great Eſtate of Land, or place of Honour and Dignity, and having the word of a King for his aſſiſtance, by his Countenance, his Court and Counſel, his Laws and Authority for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof; how doth this raiſe up, and enlarge the heart of this man with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in the proſecution of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and confirm his hope of attaining his end therein? How much more may the Chriſtian-Soul be raiſed up with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and his heart enlarged with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements in his deſign for holineſs,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:152215:113"/> and hope of attaining unto the perfection thereof? Conſidering he hath not only the command, but alſo the promiſe of him who is the King of Kings, the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Immortal, and Omni-preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Heaven and Earth, with all his Heavenly Court and Counſel, Laws and holy Appointments to protect and aſſiſt us in the management of this great deſign for our attainments unto holineſs; <hi>without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O what an aſſiſtance is this, for a poor Soul to have the whole Court of Heaven to aſſiſt him in his deſign and management thereof, where God the Father by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appointment doth ordain his holy Word and Counſel therein, to inform us, his holy Spirit to enable us, his holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to encamp about us, to miniſter ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to us in the ſaid deſign, and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Son, Jeſus Chriſt, to Crown us with the perfection of Holineſs in himſelf; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering alſo that he is faithful that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, who alſo will do it.</p>
                     <p>O what great encouragement is this that the Lord hath laid before us? What rich grace is this, that God doth not only command us to be holy, becauſe he is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but attends upon us with all holy means appertaining to the attainment of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:152215:113"/> an holy ſtate; that we in a good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the means, according to his Counſel againſt Sin and Satan, and our own Corruptions for the attainment of a holy life; we might both Plow in hope, and Sow in the hope of Reaping a ſure and certain Eſtate of holineſs in its perfection, to the great joy and conſolation of the Soul, in the ſweet enjoyments of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Lord: But Thirdly,</p>
                     <p>As we may be encouraged in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, by the warrantableneſs of it, God highly approving of it; and ſecondly, from the promiſe of God to aſſiſt us in the management of the deſign: So thirdly, we may be much encouraged upon the conſideration of the faithfulneſs of him that hath promiſed aſſiſtance to us; <hi>Know therefore</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) that the Lord thy God, is God, the Faithful God which keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Covenant and Mercy with them that love him, and keep his Commandements to a thouſand Generations,</hi> Deut. 7.9. This is an excellent encourageing argument and attribute of God, to ſtrengthen the courage and confidence of a Chriſtian in his deſign, for the perfecting holineſs in the fear of God; if a Chriſtian in the management of this deſign, do meet with temptations and oppoſitions by the Luſts
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:152215:114"/> of the fleſh, the Devil, or Wicked men, here is a ſpecial ground of courage and confidence; <hi>God is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that ye are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but will with the temptation alſo, make a way to eſcape, that ye may be able to bear it,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.13.</p>
                     <p>Should a Chriſtian in his management of this deſigne be poſſeſſed with ſome fear or jealouſie of its own Imperfections and Weakneſſes, that by reaſon of the ſame it ſhall not attaine unto an eſtate of Holineſs, to ſtand acceptable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame in the ſight of God: Here in this Caſe-conſider, that <hi>God is faithful who hath Called you unto the fellowſhip of his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8, 9.</note> 
                        <hi>who will alſo confirme you unto the End: that ye may be blameleſs in the Day of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Wherefore thou Chriſtian Soul preſſing after the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Holineſs, conſider Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs as a remedy againſt any fears, doubts, or jealouſies, that may ariſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſight or ſenſe of thy own weakneſs and imperfections: hath God alſo called thee unto the fellowſhip of his Son, to walk with him in his holy Laws and Council contained in his Word, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving againſt Sin, for to attain unto an
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:152215:114" rendition="simple:additions"/> Holy ſtate? God hath alſo called thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fellowſhip of his Son, in the participation of his Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs; in which Robes he will accept thee as unblameable in his ſight: <hi>Faithful is he that calleth you, who alſo will do it,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.24. Therefore preſs after Holineſs, but againſt the defilements of ſin, depending on Chriſt for perfection therein, who Crowns Saints endeavours, and adds to their ſtore, his own perfect purity; to acceptance evermore.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thou haſt a few names</hi> (ſaith the Lord to the Church of <hi>Sardis) That have not defiled their Garments.</hi> It ſeemeth theſe few perſons did carefully endeavour in the uſe of the means, to keep up and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the life and power of Godlineſs in them, ſo as not to allow themſelves in that deadneſs and ſloathfulneſs that others were found in, nor in thoſe falſe doctrins and opinions that were on foot among others; neither in thoſe looſe and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious practices and abominations of the times; but their hearts being real to the Lord, and their careful endeavours was to keep themſelves undefiled from the ſins of the times.</p>
                     <p>So the Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth record them here, according to their careful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:152215:115"/> and integrity of their hearts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they might have failings and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, without which there is no man on this ſide the grave; yet they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not allowed but endeavoured againſt, the Lord ſeems to take not any notice thereof, nor layeth any thing to their charge on that account; for as much as ſuch ſouls, thus conſciencious of ſin, do in the ſence of their own imperfections, the more humble themſelves before the Lord, admiring his mercy, and judge themſelves unworthy of the ſame. Well, but what of theſe few; <hi>They</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>ſhall walk with me in white, for they are worthy. Note,</hi> here for encouragement in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for holy attainments, two things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially laid down in promiſe to ſuch: Firſt, Union with Chriſt in his white robes of Innocency, Righteouſneſs, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the perfection thereof; Chriſt will cover the failings and imperfections of ſuch ſouls with his own perfections. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly: Here is Communion with Chriſt, Chriſt accepts them in Communion with himſelf; <hi>They ſhall walk with me in white:</hi> Chriſt puts his perfections upon them, as aforeſaid, and makes them meet-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions for himſelf; <hi>They ſhall walk with me:</hi> O what rich grace is this? what an
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:152215:115"/> encouragement is here to preſs after ſuch attainments, when Chriſt hath engaged himſelf to make up our wants with his own fulneſs; our imperfections, with his own perfections, and thereby make us meet for fellowſhip with himſelf; <hi>They ſhall walk with me in white, for they are worthy. Note,</hi> Here Chriſt ſeems to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute a worthineſs in them of theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, although in all that they have done, is but their duty, and not deſerving at the hand of Chriſt ſo great priviledges; but ſuch is the gracious goodneſs of the Lord, that he will not let the gift of a <hi>cup of cold water,</hi> Math. 10.42. that is given to one of his Diſciples, for his ſake, go unrewarded; how much more reſpects will he freely ſhow towards thoſe that for his ſake in love to him, do improve his Counſel unto a denial of themſelves in all <hi>ungodlineſs and worldly</hi> (Tit. 2.11, 12.) <hi>Luſts and Vanities,</hi> to walk with Chriſt in his Counſel, confeſſing his Name, and profeſſing his truth, in oppoſition to Sin, the World, and the Devil, to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of this deſign of perfecting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in the fear of God, to the glory of his Name: Yea, ſo doth Chriſt reſpect ſuch ſouls, that he confirms his former words with a ſecond Confirmation; <hi>He that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercometh
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:152215:116"/> the ſame, ſhall be Cloathed with white Rayment, and I will not blot his name out of the book of Life, but I will confeſs his name before my Father, and before his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> Rev. 3.5. O what great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements hath the Lord laid before us! if we are upon the management of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for holineſs in the way of Chriſt's Counſel, He will Cloath us with his own Robes, and keep our names clear in the book of Life; and confeſs our names, and bear his Teſtimony for us before his <hi>Father,</hi> and before his <hi>Angels,</hi> as he alſo teſtifyeth, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.32.</p>
                     <p>O behold the faithfulneſs of God, that as he hath commanded us to be holy, ſo hath he graciouſly promiſed his aſſiſtance to us in our endeavours, by his Divine Counſel in his Word to inform us, by his Spirit to enable us, his Angels to ſecure us; and by his Son, to Crown our weak per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances with his own perfections, to his gracious acceptation; <hi>He hath made us accepted in the beloved,</hi> Eph. 1.6.</p>
                     <p>Thus having briefly preſented three ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral grounds, comprehending many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, for encouragement to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſoul, that in love and loyalty to the Lord, entereth a deſign for holy attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. As firſt: The warrantableneſs of the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:152215:116"/> deſign, God manifeſting his approbation of it by his command thereunto. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly: God's promiſe of aſſiſtance. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: His faithfulneſs in performing of his Promiſe. I ſhall only preſent a fourth ground of encouragement, which is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                     <p>A fourth ground of encouragement in this deſign, is, The ſure reward that is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed by promiſe unto thoſe ſouls that in the way of God, do manage a deſign for the attainment of a holy ſtate; unto ſuch ſouls there is a ſure reward, as ſaith the Spirit of God by <hi>Solomon: The Wicked worketh a deceitful work; but to him that ſoweth Righteouſneſs, is a ſure reward,</hi> Prov. 11.18.</p>
                     <p>This Reward, is ſometimes in Scripture called the Reward of Inheritance, as in <hi>Col.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Whatſoever ye do, do it hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, as to the Lord, and not to men; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that of the Lord ye ſhall receive the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Inheritance, for ye ſerve the Lord Chriſt;</hi> alſo this Inheritance is ſaid to be an Eternal Inheritance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. and an <hi>Inheritance incorruptible,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4. Sometimes it is called a Kingdom; as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34. and in <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32. <hi>Fear not little Flock, it is your Fathers good pleaſure to give you the Kingdom, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:152215:117"/> that cannot be moved,</hi> Heb. 12.28. Sometimes in Scripture, this Inheritance or Kingdom is called Eternal Life, as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28. <hi>My Sheep hear my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>oyce, and they follow me, and I give unto them Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand:</hi> See further <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.46. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> But where is this Inheritance or Kingdom, ſaith the enquiring ſoul, that I may behold it?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>It is reſerved in the Heavens, for you that are kept by the power of God through faith unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4, 5. Note, its by the power of God, that ye are kept thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; the power of God in the operation of his Word, and efficacy of his Spirit, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, and by the Word; therefore love the Word, delight therein, hold it faſt, <hi>its the power of God unto Salvation, unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that believeth,</hi> Rom. 1.16. Note alſo, its through faith; therefore look well to your faith, make not ſhiprack of faith, but keep up faith in its due exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, for ye are kept by the power of God, through faith, unto ſalvation. The Servants of God, of old, did behold the promiſed Inheritance by faith, to their great comfort and encouragement, as ſaith
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:152215:117"/> the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> chap. 11. Theſe all dyed in faith, not having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Promiſes; but having ſeen them afar off, and were perſwaded of them, and embraced them, and confeſſed that they were Strangers and Pilgrims on the Earth: <hi>Moſes</hi> by faith, beheld this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward, and in reſpect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, he choſe rather to ſuffer afflictions with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; for he had reſpect to the Recompence of Reward.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> But when will it be that this promiſed Inheritance and Reward ſhall be poſſeſſed by the Believer, preſſing after holineſs? many have been in the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a thing indeed, but <hi>ſince the Fathers fell aſleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.4.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> affirmeth, <hi>That the Lord is not ſlack, as ſome men count ſlackneſs, but is long ſuffering to us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.9. It may be that God hath ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple yet to Convert, and to add unto his Church, that his coming is prolonged: <hi>But the day of the Lord will come as a Thief in the Night, in the which the Heavens
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:152215:118"/> ſhall paſs away with a great noyſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat; the Earth alſo, and the works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up:</hi> Seeing then that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, what manner of perſons ought ye to be in all holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and Godlineſs? Nevertheleſs, we according to his promiſe, look for new Heavens, and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs. It is enough for us that we have the word of promiſe made out, and confirmed to us by the Eternal and Infinite God to exerciſe our faith and hope upon; and it is our duty to wait upon him in faith and patience, for the performance of the ſame unto us in his time: It is his own free gift, not our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, and that he will at laſt accompliſh it to any ſoul, it is infinite mercy to be admired. The ſpirit of God hath ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us, that it will be performed at the ſecond coming of Chriſt perſonally, as in <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4. <hi>When Chriſt, who is our life, ſhall appear, then ſhall we alſo appear with him in Glory;</hi> whereunto agreeth the words of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> chap. 4.16, 17, 18. which words are theſe; <hi>For the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the voyce of the Arch-angel, and with the Trump of God,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:152215:118"/> and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt; then we which are alive, and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the Ayr, and ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord, wherefore comfort one another with theſe words;</hi> and in <hi>chap.</hi> 5. <hi>Comfort your ſelves together, and edifie one another, even as alſo ye do,</hi> verſ. 11. Whence <hi>Note</hi> by the way, that it is the duty of Chriſtians, and the property of ſouls, eſpouſed to Chriſt, ſo to apply and improve the promiſe of Chriſt's ſecond perſonal coming, as to make it a ground of comfort and encouragement one to another, of edification in, and the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all his holy appointments perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veringly.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſufferings, being converſant with his Diſciples, and fore-ſeeing the ſorrow and trouble that would attend them after his departure; he, for their better ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, encouragement, and comfort under the ſame, leaveth them this Cordial to feed upon; <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye believe in God, believe alſo in me; in my Fathers Houſe are many Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; if it were not ſo, I would have told you; I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:152215:119"/> again and receive you to my ſelf, that where I am, ye may be alſo,</hi> Joh. 14.1, 2, 3. The Lord hath furniſhed the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with plenty of proviſion of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as if his faithful Servants were likely to have great need of encouragements, ſupport, and comfort after his departure, by reaſon of the many troubles and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions the world would raiſe againſt them in their faithful obedience unto him; ſo that, as the reward of Inheritance is ſure, and certain to the faithful; ſo the more full accompliſhment thereof, will at the ſecond coming and glorious appearing of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, be performed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But of the day and hour knoweth no man,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>no not the Angels in Heaven, but the Father only,</hi> Matth. 24.36. But as a Thief in the Night, will it come ſuddenly upon all that dwell upon the Earth; the which doth invite every ſoul to a diligent <hi>watchfulneſs</hi> in the way of God, and a patient waiting in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation thereof, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.42.</p>

Heb.</hi> 10.35, 36, 37. Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>he ſaw under the Alter the Souls of them that were ſlain for the Word of God, and the Teſtimony that they held; crying, how long Lord, wilt thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the Earth; and white Robes were given to every one of them; and it was ſaid unto them, that they ſhould reſt for a little ſeaſon, until their fellow Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants alſo, and their Brethren that ſhould be killed as they were, ſhould be fulfilled,</hi> Rev. 6.9, 10. It may be the Lord hath ſome of his Servants yet to ſuffer for his ſake, that his comeing is yet prolonged: <hi>And white Robes were given them, and it was ſaid, that they muſt reſt for a little ſeaſon,</hi> &amp;c. whence <hi>Note,</hi> firſt, That Innocent blood cryeth for the haſtening of Chriſt's coming to judge and revenge its cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt its Perſecutors; and the Lord will aſſuredly in due time anſwer the cryes thereof. Secondly, <hi>Note,</hi> That Chriſt's Perfection, with the Reward of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:152215:120"/> being ſealed and aſſured to a Soul by the influences and opperations of the ſpirit of Chriſt, as a pledge of the Fathers love and ſpecial favour, ſhould be unto every ſuch ſoul of an inducing nature, to move and draw forth the ſoul to exerciſe faith and patience, to wait upon the Lord, with a dependency upon him to plead its cauſe, and to revenge its wrongs, and to perform the accompliſhment of all his promiſes in his own time; he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, maketh not haſt, he waiteth God's time as the beſt time.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, conſidering that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of a deſign for holy attainments, is attended with ſuch encouragements, as God's Approbation and Command, and his promiſe of aſſiſtance in the way of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and his crowning our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours with perfection in his Son, and with a Reward of an Eternal Inheritance, to be fully poſſeſſed by the holy people, the Saints of the moſt high God, at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming of Chriſt, perſonally bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his reward with him; therefore Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, <hi>Building up your ſelves on your moſt holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghoſt, keep your ſelves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto Eternal Life,</hi> Jude <hi>v.</hi> 20.</p>

                     <p>And as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> was, by the report ſhe had heard drawn forth to make an experiment of <hi>Solomons</hi> Magnificence, by putting her ſelf upon a Journey to his Court: So hoping that ſome ſouls may be provoked to put forth it ſelf upon a journey towards the Heavenly Court in the paths of Holineſs, upon the report of the excellent priviledges thereof, to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periencing of the Magnificence of the ſame, although not the one half be declared. Conſider with me theſe few particulars as privilegdes appertaining to the heirs of the aforeſaid Inheritance or Kingdom, to be experienced by a perfect poſſeſſion at the ſecond coming of Chriſt perſonally.</p>
                     <p>The firſt general priviledge including many particulars, we ſhall conſider to conſiſt in that excellent and glorious change of the body which at that day ſhall be effected in the Reſurrection thereof, with a uniting of body and ſpirit; in which glorious change the body will be
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:152215:121"/> Immortal, no more ſubject unto death; a ſpiritual body, no more ſubject to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her, thurſt, cold, ſickneſs, nor any putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction whatſoever; an Incorruptible body, no more ſubject to ſin, temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſorrow, fears, tears, nor terrors, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the apprehenſions of any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion by man, nor any diſpleaſure of Almighty God; but a glorious body, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together capable of beholding the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Eſſence, &amp; beautifical preſence of the glorious Majeſty of the Lord, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth the beholding with a mortal eye; for evidences hereunto, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.4. <hi>Our Converſation is in Heaven</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>from whence we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall change our vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious Body, according to the working, whereby he is able to ſubdue all things to himſelf,</hi> Phil. 3.20, 21. <hi>We know</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>John) that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. <hi>Now we ſee through a glaſs darkly, but then face to face; now we know in part, but then ſhall we know as we are known,</hi> 1 Cor 13.12.</p>
                     <p>He that hath this hope, purifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf even as he is pure: O thou that art in
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:152215:122"/> the management of a deſign for Holy At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, here is a ground of comfort, encouragement and conſolation to thy ſoul, although men may kill this vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and cut thee off in the way, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deprive thee of thy end; thou ſhalt be raiſed again, a glorious body like unto him, who is able to ſubdue all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf, and be made capable of that glory, that no mortal eye is able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, nor tongue expreſs: But Secondly,</p>
                     <p>As the body ſhall at that day admit of a glorious change, as to be like his glorious body, ſo the will, the affections, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very faculty of the ſoul, ſhall in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unity, be tranſendently glorious with the Image of God: That ſoul, that in this life, by ſome beams and influences of Chriſt's love, is drawn and contracted in love to Chriſt, and holy longings after further Communion with him, ſhall then have its deſires accompliſhed in the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence of her Beloved; then will that glorious Marriage between Chriſt and his Spouſe, be gloriouſly, ſolemnized with the glorious preſence of God the Father, and Chriſt the Bridegroom, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with an innumerable company of Angels; then ſhall ſouls Eſpouſed to Chriſt here in this day of grace, by ſome
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:152215:122"/> ſtreams of Chriſt's love, be then filled with the Ocean of divine love from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; then will Chriſt beautifie and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn his Beloved with the glorious beauty of himſelf, and make her beautiful and comely, and delightful unto himſelf; yea, in that day will Chriſt give his Spouſe the right hand of fellowſhip, he will ſet them on his right hand with this ſweet ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Come ye Bleſſed of my Father, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom prepared for you before the foundation of the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O conſider, if ſome drams of Divine Love in Chriſt will in this day of grace comfort and refreſh a ſoul, and give cauſe of rejoycing, how much more will the ſoul be filled with joy and conſolation, when it cometh to live in the full Ocean of Divine Love from Eternity? Surely this is joy unſpeakable, and full of glory; but Thirdly:</p>
                     <p>A third priviledge belonging to this Kingdom, or reward of Inheritance, may be conſidered, conſiſting of moſt excellent Aſſociates, Companions in fellowſhip and communion together: That ſoul now preſſing after holineſs in this day of grace, and now delighting in ſuch Companions, in whom evidences of grace appeareth, ſhall there live in the full enjoyment of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:152215:123"/> Communion with God the Father of all our mercies, and with God the Son, the Redeemer of all our comforts, and with the Holy Ghoſt, God equal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son;<note place="margin">See <hi>Heb.</hi> 12 22, 33, 24.</note> the Illuminator of our underſtandings, the quickner of us in the life of grace, the ſanctifier of us to the ſubduing of ſin, the helper of our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and infirmities in our Chriſtian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the ſeal of our Redemption, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Adoption; the ſouls comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Tribulation, and director in all the paths of holineſs; together with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable company of Angels and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Saints, whoſe Communion of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhall flow from a perfect union of ſpirit; ſolemnizing a perpetual Sabbath to the Lord, in Praiſes and Thankſgivings, in perfection of purity, and real-hearted ſincerity in fulneſs of joy and conſolation; while the Ignorant, and Prophane, the Carnal Worldling, and the Voluptuous, with the Time-ſerving Formaliſt, that have ſpent the day of grace in purſuit of their own carnal intereſt, little minding the intereſt of Jeſus Chriſt in the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeps of the New Man, which is Created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs, ſhall have no part in the Reſurrection with them that ſhall be counted worthy, or
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:152215:123" rendition="simple:additions"/> made meet for theſe priviledges, but ſhall be everlaſtingly excluded this Heavenly fellowſhip, with all the appurtenances thereunto belonging, having not ſo much much as one dram of God's love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to abate the flames of thoſe horrors and terrors ceaſing upon their ſouls, through the ſence of Sin and Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the ſame, in that Eternal Wrath and fiery Indignation of the Almighty, where the Worm of Conſcience is always gnawing, with Accuſations of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the juſt and holy Laws of a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God, the Fire of whoſe Wrath, and Flames of Divine Vengeance never goeth out, but will be everlaſtingly burning in the ſoul, time without end; where the beſt Aſſociates, and chiefeſt Companions will be the Devils and damned Spirits in Hell, and the beſt harmonious melody will be Confuſion of howlings for extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of pain, and gnaſhing of Teeth in endleſs ſorrows. But Fourthly:</p>
                     <p>A fourth priviledge in this Reward of Inheritance, or glorious Kingdom, to be enjoyed by thoſe perſons that in this day of grace preſs after holy attainments per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveringly, may be conſidered conſiſting in a due proportion of the Inheritance and Heavenly Manſions, every one an Heir,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:152215:124"/> joynt-Heir with Chriſt; every one a free poſſeſſion, and every one free in his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; every one a full poſſeſſion, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one full of true content with his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; every one a poſſeſſion full of true delight, comfort, and ſatisfaction; and every ſoul taking a full delight, comfort, and ſatisfaction in his poſſeſſion; every one a peaceable poſſeſſion, and every one acting peaceably in his poſſeſſion; every one a poſſeſſion full of divine love, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one acting in his poſſeſſion in that principle of divine love, which worketh no ill to his Neighbour; every one a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion full of the glory of the Lord; and every one rendering glory unto the Lord in his poſſeſſion. <hi>He that overcometh ſhall Inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he ſhall be my Son,</hi> Rev. 21.4. <hi>And if Sons, then Heirs, Heirs of God, and joynt-Heirs with Chriſt; if we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together,</hi> Rom. 8.17. <hi>And there ſhall be no more Curſe, but the Throne of God, and of the Lamb ſhall be in the City of their Habitations, and his Servants ſhall ſerve him, and they ſhall ſee his face, and his Name ſhall be in their foreheads,</hi> Rev. 22.3, 4. But Fifthly:</p>
                     <p>A fifth priviledge conſiderable in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, may be in the perpetuity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:152215:124"/> A man, Heir to an Earthly Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and entering into poſſeſſion of the ſame, in conſidering the great benefit that it will be unto him, many times his heart is raiſed up with joy and delight therein; but conſidering again on the other hand, how ſoon death may take him away from it, or an Enemy by force and violence take it from him, or conſidering how ſoon he may be ſurpriſed with afflictions in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or mind, or in both; whereby the comfortable enjoyment of this poſſeſſion may be taken off; he conſidering the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty thereof, how doth this abate the delight and comfortable ſatisfaction that the poor Creature did ſeem to fancy to himſelf?</p>
                     <p>But as for this Heavenly Inheritance, it is perpetually ſure to every ſoul poſſeſſed thereof; and therefore, as it is a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion yielding a fulneſs of true delight and comfort unto perfection of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the firſt enjoyment of poſſeſſion: So the conſolation thereof, is no whit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated or leſſened by any fears, or doubts that may ariſe concerning a deprivation: There is no place left for fears nor doubts where the poſſeſſion is ſo, ſurely founded and confirmed: <hi>As for this Inheritance</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) it is incorruptible and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:152215:125"/> &amp; that fadeth not away, its a Kingdom that cannot be moved;</hi> It is an Eternal Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Inheritance, founded upon the Baſis of Eternal love, even the infinite love of the Eternal God, and confirmed unto the Heirs thereof by the Eternal decree of the incorruptible &amp; unchangable God; &amp; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden, &amp; maintained by the Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Omniſciency, Omnipreſence, Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, &amp; Incomprehenſibility of the ſame Eternal, Infinite, and Everlaſting God; Everlaſting in his love to thoſe Souls in poſſeſſion of this Inheritance; Everlaſting in his peace which paſſeth all underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Everlaſting in his glorious preſence, that filleth all in all; <hi>And there ſhall be no Night there, and they need no Candle, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light of the Sun; for the Lord God giveth them light, and they ſhall raign for ever and ever,</hi> Rev. 22.5. <hi>Therefore, we receiving a Kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may ſerve God, acceptably with reverence and Godly fear,</hi> Heb. 12.28.</p>
                     <p>For as much as the Kingdom is Unmovable and Everlaſting; ſo alſo is the joy and conſolation of the Inhabitants thereof an Everlaſting Joy and Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which neither Men nor Devils can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the ſoul of. Death cannot do it,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:152215:125"/> there ſhall be no more death, no more ſorrow, no more pain, no more hailing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Captivity, nor complaining in the Streets, by reaſon of Oppreſſion; but all Violence ſhall be done away, and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Joy, Peace, Comfort, and Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſhall be as a Crown upon the heads and hearts of theſe Inhabitants: God ſhall be all in theſe ſouls, and theſe ſouls ſhall be all in God, by a Union of qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations Divine, and the ſweet enjoyments of his glorious benefits, the height, the length, breadth, &amp; depth, whereof eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive. Too narrow is the capacity of mortal man to comprehend, and the tongue of Men and Angels to expreſs the Latitude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: <hi>Wherefore gird up the loyns of your minds; be ſober, and hope to the end for the Grace that is to be brought unto you at the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, as obedient Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, not faſhioning your ſelves according to the former luſts in your Ignorance; but as he that hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of Converſation, becauſe it is written, be ye holy, for I am holy,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.13, 14, 15, 16. But ſixthly:</p>
                     <p>A ſixth priviledge appertaining to the Heirs of this Kingdom, to be by them
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:152215:126"/> enjoyed at Chriſt's perſonal appearing at his ſecond coming, may be conſidered herein, for to conſiſt, that he that is their Head and Husband, with whom there is a unity of Affection and Covenant-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and is the Recorder for his Eſpouſed Souls, that puts their tears in his Bottel, and Records their ſufferings in his book of Remembrance, and by whom, and for what, even for their love to him, and loyalty to his Supremacy in the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Laws, and for rejecting the contrary. This is a great ground of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, that he that is their Recorder, their Head and Husband, is the only po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate King of Kings, and Judge of all the World, who will bring his Records with him, and make his perſonal appearance in the glory of his Majeſty, and ſeat of Juſtice, attended with his glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and glorified Saints to Judge the World in Righteouſneſs, who will not reſpect perſons in Judgment, nor pervert Judgment for gifts nor reward; but in Righteouſneſs will he Judge the cauſe of the Poor, and with Equity will he plead for the Meek of the Earth; who will then plead the cauſe of his people with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt thoſe that in this time of their Pilgrimage have oppreſſed and perſecuted
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:152215:126"/> them. A poor man being oppreſſed by one that is too potent for him, and being not able to relieve himſelf, he maketh his addreſs unto the King, laying open his cauſe before him, reſolving to wait with patience for his relief; at length the King ariſeth, and taketh this poor mans cauſe into his hand, and pleadeth it with his Adverſary, and rights him in his wrongs, and avengeth him of his Oppreſſor. O how doth this adminiſter comfort to this poor man! O how doth this oblige and endear the affections of this Poor man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Prince, and fill his heart with joy and gladneſs, and thankſgiving for ſuch a benefit; and ſhall not God avenge his own Elect, which cry day and night un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, though he bear long with them, they having committed their cauſe unto Him, and caſt their burthen upon him? yea (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>I tell you he will avenge them ſpeedily:</hi> O what Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth this bring unto oppreſſed Souls in the cauſe of God, and eſpecially when the Lord ſhall plead their cauſe with their Adverſaries, what praiſes will it bring forth unto his Name: <hi>I heard</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>John) a great voyce of much people in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying Alleluja, Salvation, and Glory, and Honour, and Power unto the Lord our

                  <head>A Glaſs for the Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, to behold their Heart-Conceptions.</head>
                  <p>WHen Honeſt-hearted <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had tidings of the decays and breaches made upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that the Walls were broken down, and the Gates burnt with fire, and the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants Captivated by their Enemy; he ſo lays it to heart, as to become ſencible of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> condition; and in the ſence thereof, he mourns with tears, he faſts from food, he humbles himſelf, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes with God by Prayer on <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems</hi> behalf. Yea, the ſadneſs of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, did demonſtrate the ſorrow of his Heart, to over-weigh all the honours, profits, and pleaſures that he did poſſeſs in King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> Court: Yea, ſo did

                  <p>And canſt not thou, O Unregenerate heart, be wrought upon to a ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of thy own Eſtate, by all the tydings brought home unto thine ears, by the infallible word of Truth, and Miniſtry thereof, informing thee of the ſad decays and breaches made upon thy precious Soul by ſin and Satan, the grand Enemies of man-kind: Haſt thou not heard that thy Walls of Security, and Ornaments of Beauty are much decayed, and many breaches made therein; (that is to ſay) thy beautiful ſtate of Righteouſneſs, and true Holineſs, in which man was at firſt Created, in which man did God's Image bare, and unto which Eſtate God did vouchſafe his Preſence for ſecurity of thy ſelf, thy Peace, thy Comfort, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation: And haſt thou not heard how by
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:152215:132"/> the Enemy all the faculties of thy Soul, and members of thy Body are Captivated under the dominion of Sin and Satan: A ſad ſervitude unto thy Eternal deſolation, except a ſupernatural means, timely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, and carefully improved to effect a Reſtoration to thy primitive Eſtate. And haſt thou not heard that a Supernatural King hath granted and given forth a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural means compounded with Divine Love and Pitty to thy poor diſtreſſed Soul and Captivated ſtate, together with an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſealed with his own Signet, for liberty to improve the means unto the aforeſaid end, with directions in the ſame, and calls thereto?

                  <p>O that thou wouldſt act <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> part, which is thy great concernment; to lay to heart thy Condition, ſo as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſenſible of thy Eſtate wherein thou ſtandeſt; and in the ſence thereof, to go unto God, and humble thy ſelf before
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:152215:133"/> him, with Chaſtiſements by Faſting, and Tears of Mourning, and lay thy Cauſe before the Lord, with ſupplications in the name of Chriſt, on thy <hi>Jeruſalems,</hi> thy precious Souls behalf: and in order to thy ſenſibility hereunto, and the quickening of thy motion herein, Conſider the words of Chriſt to the unprofitable Servant; <hi>thou oughteſt to have put my money to the Exchangers:</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, thou oughteſt to exerciſe thoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faculties of Rationality and Memory, that God hath beſtowed on thee, by a due Conſideration, and ſerious Meditation in the Word.

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:152215:133"/> Love and Faithfulneſs againſt Sin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Deceitfulneſs; then happily thou mighteſt obtain a ſence of thy condition, as thou ſtandeſt in thy Unregenerate and Barren ſtate, and ſee that it is time for thee to ſeek the Lord, <hi>and to break up thy fallow ground, and to Sow in Righteouſneſs, in hope to Reap in Mercy:</hi> ſee <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.12. and to wait upon God in the uſe of God's appointed means, until he rain the dews of Grace and Righteouſneſs upon thee.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Nehemiah</hi> came to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                  <p>And although this obſtructive Rubbiſh was ſo very much, that it required many hands and heavy burthens with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and induſtry to remove and clear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: yet this Obſtruction muſt firſt be done away, otherwiſe it would deceive their work, and cauſe their labour to be in vain.</p>
                  <p>Now wouldeſt thou, in the ſence of thy decayed and falne ſtate, act <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> part in the uſe of the means appointed thereunto? to be a Renewer or Repairer
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:152215:134"/> of thoſe decays and breaches in thee made by the Enemy of thy Proſperity, Peace, and Happineſs; then thou muſt with <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> wiſely ſeek God's aſſiſtance, and ſet thy ſelf with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to remove the Rubbiſh, thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Luſts and Sins that lye as grand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in the way to our Attainments, in the work of our Reparations and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of our firſt Eſtate in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, true Peace and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore in order to our better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and ſenſibility of thoſe grand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions prejudicial to the work, and for our better inducement, to improve our utmoſt abilities with all diligence to a removal thereof, that our atchievements may be the more proſperous and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: Conſider with me the enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, raiſed upon theſe following words written, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.15.</p>

                     <head>The Horſeleach hath two Daughters, crying, <hi>Give, Give,</hi> Prov. <hi>30.15.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>AS all Scripture was given by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and is profitable; and whatſoever was written afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, was written for our Learning; ſo doubtleſs this ſmall part or portion of holy Scripture afore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hath ſomething in it of profit and uſe to the Sons of men in the right Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</p>
                     <p>Should we conſider the words by way of diviſion, we may therein obſerve three parts:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, A ſubject bearing the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Horſeleach.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, A ſecond part relating to the <hi>Horſeleach,</hi> as conceived and brought forth by her, demonſtrated by the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of her <hi>Daughters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A third particular obſervable, is, their qualifications, or natural proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties demonſtrated in theſe words,
<q>Crying, Give, Give.</q>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:152215:135"/>
                     <p>Should we conſider the words by way of Explication, it will not be unneceſſary, in the firſt place, to conſider that it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten-times the method of the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture-Record, by way of ſimilitude, or parable, to illuſtrate the natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of one thing by the name of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing of the ſame nature; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, The Spirit of God, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Zephaniah,</hi> illuſtrateth, or ſetteth forth the natural properties and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> Rulers, in reſpect of their Oppreſſions and Cruelties impoſed upon the people under their jurisdiction by the names of Lyons and Wolves; <hi>Her Princes within her</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are roaring Lyons, her Judges are Evening Woolves, they gnaw not the bones till the morrow,</hi> Zeph. 3.3.</p>
                     <p>So likewiſe <hi>David</hi> ſetteth forth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and diſpoſition of his Enemies by the Denomination of Lyons; <hi>My Soul</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is among Lyons;</hi> I lye even <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that are ſet on fire, even the Sons of men, whoſe teeth are Spears and Arrows, and their tongue a ſharp ſword, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a net for my ſteps,</hi> Pſal. 57.1, 6.</p>
                     <p>So our Saviour Chriſt demonſtrates the natural properties and diſpoſitions of his Deſciples or Believers, as they are Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:152215:135"/> by the denomination of <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Lambs,</hi> as in <hi>John</hi> 21.15, 16. and <hi>John</hi> 10. and that in reſpect of their harmleſs nature, and peaceable deportment which they bare, or ought to bare towards all men, even towards their Perſecutors; and in this ſence Chriſt himſelf is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called a Lamb, and compared to a Sheep; yea many Teſtimonies of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may we find in holy Scripture to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence this; that it is the method of the holy Ghoſt many times to illuſtrate the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of one thing by the name of another of the like nature: So now in the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Text of Scripture I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame method, according to what I have received now by this <hi>Horſeleach,</hi> (my judgment is) that the Holy Ghoſt doth mind to illuſtrate ſome other thing of the like nature, yet more myſterious: Now we know that the <hi>Horſeleach</hi> is a certain Worm, whoſe appetite doth much delight in blood, and after it, they natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are very greedy and inſatiable; therefore Phyſitians make uſe of the <hi>Horſeleach</hi> to draw blood from their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients as they ſee occaſion; yea ſo inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and greedy is her appetite after blood, that if ſhe once faſten upon a man, ſhe would ſuck and drain all the blood out
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:152215:136"/> of every Vein and part of the body, to the deſtruction of the life, if poſſible ſhe could contain it, and ſuffered thereunto; ſuch is her natural properties. Now that which this <hi>Horſeleach</hi> doth in its natural proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to us reſemble and ſimily forth, is that myſterious <hi>Horſeleach</hi>-Corruption that ceaſed upon mans heart, and did take up its Reſidence there by the firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</p>
                     <p>The which Corruption, is <hi>Horſeleach</hi>-like in her natural properties, ſo inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and greedy, that by her operation and powerful influence, ſhe will ſearch into every Vein, Member, and faculty of Body and Soul, and ſuck and draw out of the ſame all that ſpiritual blood, and life of God, and power of Godlineſs which man was inveſted with in his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, until ſhe hath wholly made the Creature like a dead man, without life and motion as to the things of God; but ſo enſlaved under the dominion of her Laws, that in conformity thereunto, the poor Creature muſt run and go at every beck, improve all Opportunities, embrace all Companions, and uſe all means, tending to the promoting of Corruptions-Intereſt, the law of Sin, to the great decay and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of mans holy and happy State.</p>
                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:152215:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>But Secondly: The Text ſaith, <hi>The Horſeleach hath two Daughters, crying, Give, Give.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It ſeemeth theſe <hi>Daughters</hi> of the <hi>Horſeleach,</hi> are for nature and quality like her ſelf, greedy inſatiable Worms; their cry is always <hi>Give, Give;</hi> they are all for themſelves, but nothing part from.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two <hi>Daughters</hi> of the <hi>Horſeleach,</hi> do much reſemble the Creatures affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they ſtand in their Unregenerate ſtate; that is to ſay, Unſanctified love, and Carnal deſire, ſometimes in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture called Luſt; and that they are the <hi>Daughters</hi> of this <hi>Horſeleach</hi>-Corruption, it may appear by theſe Reaſons: Firſt, They bare her name, they are <hi>Corrupt Affections.</hi> Secondly: They bare her nature, they are <hi>Inordinate Affections.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Col</hi> 3 5.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as they are Inordinate in reſpect of their being out of that order, wherein God at firſt placed them, which was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, to be unto him, and to him only; ſo are they Inordinate in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable Covetouſneſs &amp; greedy diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons after other objects, as if they could never have enough; always their cry is, <hi>Give, Give.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly: That they are the <hi>Daughters</hi> of that <hi>Horſeleach</hi> Corruption, doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:152215:137"/> appear by their ſubjection to the law of Corruption; they are as obedient to the Law of Corruption, as a Daughter can be to the Law of her Mother; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that they and the whole man ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their courſe, are by the Holy Ghoſt demonſtrated to be the Servants of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
                     <p>Yea, as the Law of Corruption, doth require theſe Daughters to Renounce God, and break Covenant with him, and joyn themſelves in a conjunction of affinity with ſelf, and the world, they readily ſubmit and yield thereto, and make the intereſt of Self and the World, the only object of their delight.</p>
                     <p>And in order to the promoting of this Intereſt of Self and the World, they (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every faculty of Soul, and member of Body) are always moving, and crying <hi>Give, Give:</hi> Give your ſtrength, your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, your motion and action, your time and opportunities in our Service to Self and the World, and to our ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the delights and pleaſures thereof, whereby the whole man is brought into Captivity and Slavery to theſe <hi>Horſeleach Daughters,</hi> theſe greedy inſatiable Worms, theſe Luſts, to Self-advancement, to world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Vanities, until the poor Soul be left as
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:152215:137" rendition="simple:additions"/> deſolate as ever <hi>Nehemiah</hi> found <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> plundred and ranſacked of all its life of God, and power of Godlineſs, true peace and happineſs, and all its gates and doors of faith and hope, and aſſurance in God burnt up and deſtroyed, and its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Ornaments of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs much defaced, and all its Walls of Fortification broken down, and the whole man laid open to the mercy of a mercileſs Enemy; to its eternal ruine, except a ſupernatural means be timely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed and improved for a remedy, to the breaking off the Creatures affections from this affinity, and to the reducing them to their firſt Eſtate.</p>
                     <p>Now that there is ſuch a conjunction of affinity, as aforeſaid, is farther evinced by the name that the Holy Ghoſt hath put upon thoſe perſons in that contract; as thoſe perſons that are joyned in a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Conjunction or Contract with Chriſt, are called Chriſtians; and as a Woman Eſpouſed to a Man, is called by his name: So hath the holy Spirit of God put the name of the world upon thoſe perſons whoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are joyned to the world; as Chriſt ſaid to thoſe in a conjunction of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection with him; <hi>Marvel not if the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:152215:138"/> hated you:</hi> Whence <hi>note,</hi> that by world, he meaneth perſons Eſpouſed in affection to the world.</p>
                     <p>So the Spirit of God (by Saint <hi>John</hi>) ſaith the whole world lyeth in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, meaning all perſons in their Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſtate, whom Corruption hath drawn off their affections from God, and ſituated them upon Self and the World: So that in this diſcourſe here is briefly and plainly ſet forth; Firſt, That by the <hi>Horſeleach,</hi> is imply'd Corruption that ceazed upon the heart of man by ſin in the firſt Tranſgreſſion; ſo conſidered from their natural properties; and the <hi>two Daughters</hi> to be the Creatures of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Unſanctified love, and Carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, as they ſtand in their Unregenerate ſtate, demonſtrated by theſe four Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</p>
                     <p>Firſt: They bare her Name.</p>
                     <p>Secondly: They bare her nature.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly: By their ſubjection to her Law.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly: by their Conjunction with the world, and ſelf-renouncing God and his Covenant; as not having any true love or deſire thereunto; and that by the influence of Corruption, whereby they are brought forth into that Eſtate.</p>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:152215:138"/>
                     <p>The Inference drawn from the words thus conſidered, is briefly thus:</p>
                     <p>That Corruption hath brought forth a ſeparation of the Creatures affections from God, and joyned them in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with Self and the World; in which Eſtate the Creatures affections are very inſatiable and greedy after Self and the Worlds intereſt, by which conjunction God is diſhonoured, and every faculty and member of ſoul and body enſlaved in ſuch ſervil motions and actions as may promote the ſaid intereſt, in order to the ſatisfying of theſe greedy Worms, until by their continual inſtigations of <hi>Give, Give,</hi> they have drained out of the poor ſoul all its ſpiritual blood, or life of God, and power of Godlineſs to its eternal ruine, except a ſupernatural means be timely applyed, and effectually improved for the reducing the ſaid affections unto their firſt Eſtate.</p>
                     <p>Now for proof of this inference here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, I think there needeth no further Teſtimony then what is contained in the explication of the words, eſpecially if Doctor <hi>Woful</hi> experience his evidence; may be heard and credited by you; yet for order-ſake, and leſt I ſhould be thought wanting in the caſe of evidence, I would
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:152215:139" rendition="simple:additions"/> produce ſome further evidences that will give in their Teſtimonies to the ſeparation and conjunction aforeſaid; as firſt, Thoſe many Teſtimonies of God in Scripture, whereby God calls to the Sons of men to return unto him: <hi>O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>return to the Lord thy God, for thou haſt fallen by thy Iniquity,</hi> Hoſ. 14.1.</p>
                     <p>Secondly: Gods Expoſtulation with man about his Apoſtacy; thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>What Iniquity have your Fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after Vanity,</hi> Jer. 2.5. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.23, 32.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly: Thoſe many Exhortations the Lord hath laid before us in his word. <hi>Set your affections on things that are above, not on things on Earth,</hi> Col. 3.2. <hi>Love not the World; if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.15. Yea, the Lord calls for ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and crucifying of the world, to mortifie every member of the body of ſin, and to ſet our love and delight in him, and that with all our hearts and ſoul, and ſtrength; all which do imply, and hold forth their evidences, in witneſs of the aforeſaid Conjunction.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly: I would add one Teſtimony more among many that might be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:152215:139" rendition="simple:additions"/> and that is the multiplication of that Succeſſion, or natural Generation, that is conceived and brought forth by vertue of the aforeſaid Conjunction of thoſe <hi>Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leach Daughters,</hi> corrupt affections, in affinity with Self and the World, as the off-ſprings thereof.</p>
                     <p>And for brevity ſake, I ſhall only name ſome few of this off-ſpring, and leave the reſt to Doctor <hi>Woful</hi>'s experience, his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to evince one part of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conceiv'd and brought forth by the ſaid Conjunction, is Pride, Envy, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, Hypocriſie, Infidelity, and Sloth in God's Service, and Voluptuouſneſs: Theſe, as a part of that Brood and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Horſeleach and her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> in affinity with Self and the World, are by their influence conceived and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed up in the heart of Unregenerate man, where the ſaid conjunction hath do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</p>
                     <p>Theſe do evidently demonſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be of that race by their natural qualities and language, inſatiable gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Worms, alaways crying, <hi>Give, Give;</hi> as for Pride, that is an inſatiable greedy Worm of an aſpiring nature; inſatiable and greedy after ſelf-honour and the worlds applauſe: It looks high and lofty,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:152215:140"/> as if it was one, by whoſe influence that generation was ſteered by, which <hi>Agur</hi> ſpeaketh of, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.13. <hi>There is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> (ſaith <hi>Agur) O how lofty are their Eyes! and their eye-lids are lifted up. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur</hi> here ſeemeth as not able to expreſs the Latitude of the aſpiring nature of Pride, and thoſe whoſe courſe is ſteered thereby, but ſtands in admiration at it; as if by the influence of Pride, thoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in whoſe heart it is predominant, were carryed up into that airy Region with that Prince ſpoken of, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. as Retainers to his Court.</p>
                     <p>But into the third Heavens, where Chriſt ſitteth at the Right Hand of God, they have no inſpection; for, ſaith the Spirit of God by the Prophet <hi>David, The Wicked, through the Pride of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, will not ſeek after God; God is not in all his thoughts,</hi> Pſal. 10.4. Whence <hi>Note,</hi> that Pride by its influence, doth work the thoughts of God, and his ways, out of the minds of thoſe, in whoſe hearts it is predominant.</p>
                     <p>Yea, This Brat, bred and nouriſhed in the heart of Unregenerate man, by thoſe <hi>Horſeleach Daughters,</hi> Unſanctified love, and Carnal deſire, through their affinity with Self and the World, doth not
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:152215:140" rendition="simple:additions"/> only plunder a ſoul of its thoughts of God, but alſo of the qualifications of Humility, Penitency, Charity, and all the peaceable habits of true Humanity, as conſidered in its firſt eſtate.</p>
                     <p>Yea, like a greedy heart-Worm; it devours and eateth up the very bowels of tender Pitty and Compaſſion, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration; and yet like one of <hi>Pharoahs</hi> lean Kine, is never the better: This Brat is ſtill crying, <hi>Give, Give;</hi> always moving the Creature to ſatisfie its greedy Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite; in order whereunto, the Creature muſt improve its Time and Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Pains, Labours, and Meditations, Conſiderations, Moneys, Lands, Livings, Lordſhips; yea, all muſt be improved and dedicated to the ſatisfying of this Brat, in beautifying the Face, powdering the Hair, new faſhions in Apparel, ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Buildings, delicious Fair, places of Honour, and worldly Preferments, and honourable Greetings, and to be called <hi>Rabbi, Rabbi:</hi> Mean while, God, and the power of Godlineſs, and the ſouls happineſs, is little conſidered. Yea, where Pride is predominant in the heart, and unſanctified love, and carnal deſire joyning therewith, produceth very ſad and dangerous effects to the Creature;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:152215:141"/> for it maketh Angels to become Devils, and Men to become Slaves to their Luſts, Enemies to God, Perſecutors of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and themſelves Subjects of Perdition: <hi>The Wicked in his Pride doth Perſecute the Poor,</hi> Pſal. 10.2. It ſeems this greedy heart-Worm of the <hi>Horſeleach</hi> brood, is a great mover to, and ſtirrer up of Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo ſaith <hi>Solomon, Only by Pride cometh Contention,</hi> Prov. 13.10.</p>
                     <p>Another greedy heart-Worm of the <hi>Horſeleach</hi>-race, and her <hi>Daughters</hi> is called <hi>Envy,</hi> this is a bloody Brat; as greedy after blood, as the <hi>Horſeleach</hi> and her <hi>Daughters,</hi> by whoſe influence it is in mans heart conceived.</p>
                     <p>This Envy, ſeems to be of a nature cruel and blood-thirſty; of Countenance fierce and grim; yea, this Brat looks, as if it would devour all the intereſt of God and Godlineſs, with the Profeſſion and Profeſſors thereof.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe perſons, whoſe courſe is ſteered by the influence of Envy, through its predominancy in the heart, may ſeem to be of that generation that <hi>Agur</hi> ſpeaks of, Prov. 30.14.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There is a Generation</hi> (ſaith <hi>Agur) whoſe Teeth are as Swords, and their jaw-Teeth as Knives to devour the Poor from off
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:152215:141"/> the Earth, and the Needy from among men;</hi> ſo ſaith <hi>David, My Soul is among Lyons;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.4, 6.</note> 
                        <hi>I lye even among them that are ſet on fire; even the Sons of men, whoſe teeth are ſpears, and arrows, and their tongue a ſharp ſword; they prepared a Net for my ſteps. Wrath is cruel, and Anger is outragious, but who can ſtand before Envy,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon?</hi> Prov. 27.4.</p>
                     <p>It is a ſad thing, and of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the Creature, for to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by the influence and inſtigations of this Blood-worm bred in the heart, and nouriſhed by corrupt affections, in affinity with Self and the World; when every member of body, and faculty of the ſoul muſt be active in their places, to contrive and wait for opportunities, and improve all means to accompliſh a ſatisfaction to this blood-thirſty-worm; although in the blood of the Innocent, as <hi>Cain</hi> to Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Brother <hi>Abel; Joſpephs</hi> Brethren to ſell him; King <hi>Herod,</hi> to kill the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> to ſatisfie theſe greedy Blood-worms in the death of Chriſt; and ſaith the Scriptures, the Prieſts moved with Envy, cryed, <hi>Crucifie him, Crucifie him:</hi> They muſt not ſpare their Breath, nor Counſel, nor Pains, nor Money, to move and ſtir up the people, both Magiſtrates,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:152215:142"/> Officers, Souldiers, and all the rude mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, to ſatisfie <hi>Envy</hi> in the blood of the Innocent.</p>
                     <p>Another greedy Worm, of the race and off-ſpring of the <hi>Horſeleach</hi> and her <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> bred in the heart of Unregenerate man, is <hi>Malice;</hi> this Brat, by its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and operation, is a great obſtructor of Peace, Unity, Charity, and all good humane Society: Yea, this heart-worm is ſo inſatiable, that its cry is always, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, Revenge;</hi> and by the inſtigations and movings thereof, together with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified love, and carnal deſire, in affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with Self and the World, through their crying, <hi>Give, Give,</hi> doth enſlave every faculty of the ſoul, and member of the body, to ride and go, contrive and ſtuddy, ſpare no coſt nor pains to improve all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, ways, and means, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, for an accompliſhment of a deſign for <hi>Revenge</hi> to ſatisfie this Brat; no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſatisfaction, nor compoſure by Friends in moderation, will ſerve; <hi>Malice</hi> crys, <hi>Revenge, Revenge:</hi> And what ſtrifes, and variances, contentions, &amp; ſad conſequences doth enſue, both Scripture-evidences, and the ſad experiences of our times do ſadly manifeſt.</p>
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:152215:142"/>
                     <p>Another of this <hi>Horſeleach</hi>-brood is <hi>Hypocriſie;</hi> This is of a more ſmoother deportment outwardly, than the former; this Brat, by its influences and opperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will get into all the performances of that Creature, in whoſe heart it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant; and like a worm in the Nut, deſtroys the kernel, the very marrow and quinteſſence of the ſaid performances, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only a fair ſmooth out-ſide ſhell: <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> will permit the Creature to do civil curteſies to a Neighbour, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious performances to God; provided always that the intereſt of Self and the World, with whom the affections are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, be not thereby prejudiced; for this Brat <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> hath always a reſpect to ſelf-intereſt. A poor Creature that is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-run with this diſtemper, if he Pray, or Preach, or give Almes, all muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to Self, ſelf-honour, ſelf-applauſe, and eſtimation, profit, and worldly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: But this end, that God may be glorified, his truth promoted, and his people edified and comforted, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in the truths of God; this, as the very kernel, marrow, and quinteſſence of Religion, is (by this heart-worm <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie</hi>) devoured, and nothing left, but a meer out-ſide, a form of Godlineſs,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:152215:143"/> without the power. Our Saviour Chriſt; like a skilful Phyſitian, could diſcover this diſtemper in the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old; and their works they do, (ſaith he) <hi>they do to be ſeen of men;</hi> and many of the chief Rulers believed, but did not confeſs him; for they loved the praiſe of men, more than the praiſe of God; Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> unto painted Sepulchres, and ſuch as make clean the out-ſide of the cup and platter, but leave the in-ſide filthy. Thoſe perſons whoſe courſe is ſteered by the influence of this heart-worm, ſeems like unto that Generation that <hi>Agur</hi> ſpeaketh of, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.12. <hi>There is a Generation</hi> (ſaith <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur) that are pure in their own eyes, but are not waſhed from their filthineſs.</hi> Self and the World is ſtill retained in affinity with the affections, whereby many evils is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: Yea, the reſidence of <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> in the heart unſubdued, is of dangerous conſequence; for, as it ſhuts out the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God in the end of our actions of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Charity, ſo it ſhuteth the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with all its performances, out of God's acceptance to glory. When poor Creatures ſhall ſay, <hi>Lord, Lord, open un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, have we not Propheſied in thy Name, and in thy Name done theſe, and the other
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:152215:143" rendition="simple:additions"/> works?</hi> And the Lord ſhall Anſwer, <hi>I know you not, depart from me, ye workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi> go to your Luſts whom ye have ſerved; as ye have dedicated all your works to the intereſt of Self and the World, now ſee if Self and the World can ſave you; and herein will theſe words of <hi>Job</hi> be found true, <hi>What is the hope of the Hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his ſoul,</hi> Job. 27.8. <hi>The hope of the Hypocrite ſhall periſh,</hi> Job. 8.13. <hi>Whoſe hope ſhall be cut off, and their truſt as a Spiders Web,</hi> ver. 14.</p>
                     <p>Another of this <hi>Horſeleach</hi> race is <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,</hi> whoſe proper nature is to oppoſe God in his diſpenſations: That Creature, in whoſe heart this greedy worm is predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate; it will give no reſt until by its inſtigations and continual crying, <hi>Give, Give;</hi> it hath brought every part, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and faculty of the whole man, to a conformity to its ſelf: This Brat hardens the heart, blinds the mind, darkens the underſtanding, ſtops the ears againſt the voyce of God, clincheth the hands againſt actions of Mercies and Charity, and makes the will averſe and ſtubborn againſt the will of God: Yea, it doth by its influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and operations, work up the Creature into its own proper nature, to oppoſe
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:152215:144" rendition="simple:additions"/> God in his diſpenſations. If God ſay, I have given my Son to Redeem thee from thine Iniquities, and to be unto thee both King, Prieſt, and Prophet, whoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel thou muſt obſerve, whoſe Righteous Laws thou muſt obey unto a Conformity unto him, and upon whoſe Attonement and Interceſſion thou muſt depend for juſtification unto life; and for his ſake thou muſt break that bond of affinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thy affections and Self, and the World; thou muſt deny Self, crucifie the world, and ſet thy affections on things that are above: <hi>Infidelity,</hi> with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſubjected thereunto, preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies; its no ſuch thing, we will not have this man to raign over us; thus <hi>Infidelity</hi> would make God a Lyar, as Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that believeth not God, hath made him a Lyar, becauſe he believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son,</hi> Joh. 5.10. O what an obſtruction is here to the Creatures attainments unto Holineſs and Heavens Happineſs! O what a ſad conſequence doth follow hereupon; <hi>He that believeth not, is Condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God,</hi> Joh. 3.18. O what a heart-worm is here, that eateth out the very life of the Creature, to Gods

                     <p>Another of this brood, is <hi>Sloath</hi> in God's Service. This greedy Heart-worm is a great obſtruction to the uſe and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſy of God's word, and to the efficacy of the Creatures performances in God's Service. This greedy Worm, by its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and operation in the heart, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours all the Creatures Zeal for God, and fervency in any performances in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the worſhip and ſervice of God. This worm doth much hinder the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and obſtruct its improvement of Gods Word and Ordinances to Gods Glory and its own benefit, by applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and meditation, and action, as it ought to do; and hence, or hereunto are thoſe words of <hi>Solomon: The ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man roaſteth not that which he took in hunting,</hi> Prov. 12.27. that is, he doth not improve the means afforded as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid: What need (ſaith <hi>Sloath</hi>) ſo much ſtrictneſs and preciſeneſs in ſpending ſo much time in reading, hearing, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, prayer, meditation, and aſſembling ſo often, it is time enough for theſe things hereafter, and the like; the which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:152215:145"/> wants that honour that is due from the Creature unto his Name; and the poor ſoul wants that ſpiritual nouriſhment, to refreſh, comfort, ſtrengthen, and ſupport it in the way to its eternal reſt, whereby the poor ſoul is impoveriſhed, and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, or at leaſt much weakened in its knowledg, faith, hope, love, zeal, and comfortable aſſurance in the Lord; which in a good improvement of the means, through Gods bleſſing hereupon, happily it might have enjoyed.</p>
                     <p>Conſider the fooliſh Virgins, and the ſloathful Servant that improved not his Talent.</p>
                     <p>Another of this Generation is <hi>Volupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> whoſe nature is moſt delightful in exceſſive feaſting, and drunkenneſs, with other carnal delights and pleaſures: This Brat once getting reſidence in the heart, and ſuffered, doth much obſtruct and deſtroy thoſe vertues of moderation, temperance, ſobriety, and charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is likewiſe an inſatiable greedy Worm, and doth much enſlave the Creature; for by its influence and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it doth ſtrongly work upon the Creature, to yeald both Perſon and Purſe, Lands, Livings, and Lordſhips, Time and Opportunity, though never ſo
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:152215:145" rendition="simple:additions"/> precious, all muſt be dedicated to the uſe and ſervice of this greedy-guts; this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable heart-worm, by whoſe influence thoſe perſons ſeem to be ſteered, that <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſpeaketh of, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe God is their belly, whoſe glory is their ſhame, who mind earthly things; but as</hi> (Solomon <hi>ſaith) A word to the Wife is ſufficient:</hi> So I do but give a hint of theſe things, to put you in mind of the ſad effects of ſin, and of that conjunction wherein the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures affections, and the world, and ſelf, are united. I have heard an Aſtrological ſtory, that when two malignant Planets, as <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> happen in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction together, in one Aſpect, Houſe, or Sign, that that altogether operate to the prejudice of man, by producing the ſad effects of loſſes, croſſes, ſickneſſes, wars, contentions, death, and the like.</p>
                     <p>But whether this be ſo, or not, ſure I am, that this is truth; that when there is a Conjunction between the Creatures affections, and ſelf, and the world, that the operations and effects thereof is ſad indeed, for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it; for, thereby the underſtanding is darkened, and the clear light of the Son of Righteouſneſs eclipſed from the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:152215:146" rendition="simple:additions"/> Soul, the apprehenſions be-nummed, the judgment miſ-informed, the will obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and averſe to the things of God; the bowels of compaſſion ſhut up, the hand of pitty clinched faſt; ſo that God may call in his word, his ſpirit may ſtrive, Chriſt may weep, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> may beg, and Chriſts Miniſters may like a Candle ſpend themſelves to give light to others, and yet all will do but little; and why?</p>
                     <p>Corruption hath wrought a Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the Creatures affections, and ſelf, and the world; and therefore ſelf-denyal, and the loſs of the worlds favour, to follow Chriſt in his ways, is become a hard ſaying, who can bare it? Many of the Rulers believed on Chriſt, ſaith the Scriptures, but they did not confeſs him, for they loved the praiſe of men, more than the praiſe of God; and many could follow Chriſt for the Loaves, for ſelf and worldly intereſts, but when it cometh to paſs, that this conjunction muſt be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ſelf, and the world muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to follow Chriſt in all his precepts and examples of ſanctity and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life, then the young man, and the old alſo, goes away ſorrowful: <hi>Demas</hi> muſt rather forſake Chriſt and his ways, and all thoſe of <hi>Aſia</hi> forſake <hi>Paul</hi> and the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:152215:146" rendition="simple:additions"/> true profeſſion of the Goſpel, rather than ſelf and the world muſt be parted with: Oh ſaith <hi>Corruption,</hi> that <hi>Horſeleach!</hi> and unſanctified <hi>Love,</hi> and carnal deſire, <hi>her Daughters!</hi> favour thy ſelf, let not theſe things be: Yea, ſo prevailing are theſe Blood-worms, even in many Goſpel-profeſſors, that it was the ſad complaint of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his days, that he had no man like-minded to <hi>Timothy,</hi> whoſe ſpecial care was for the promoting of Chriſts intereſt in his truth and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>all ſeek their own, and not the things of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that God doth ſo often give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own people, even his choſen ones and dear Children, the bitter cup of the wormſeed of Afflictions, on purpoſe to break the bed of theſe Heart-worms, and ſubdue them: and the oftner, becauſe his people do often through careleſneſs and negligence of improving the means af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded, ſuffer theſe greedy worms to breed and multiply in their hearts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſtomack groweth weak, as to a ſpiritual digeſtion of the Heavenly Manna of Gods word, and the conjunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the affections, and ſelf, and the world, the more ſtrengthened.</p>

                     <p>It is Gods uſual way in ſuch caſes, ever and anon to give his people a cup of that wormſeed-bitter-afflictions, yet mixt with Divine love, and ſaving ends, as to break the aforeſaid conjunction, and to cleanſe the heart of corruption, and to bring the affections home unto himſelf, and to quicken the appetite unto a good digeſtion of the adminiſtrations of his grace in all his diſpenſations.</p>

                     <p>But is it ſo? that corruption hath brought forth ſuch a ſeparation of the Creatures affections from God, unto a conjunction with ſelf, and the world, to the conception of many evils which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cured, but by a ſupernatural means; it may put us into an admiration upon a two-fold account; as firſt, we may ſtand and wonder with admiration, to behold what a miſtery of Iniquity, what a <hi>Babel</hi> of Confuſion is wrought in the heart of man in his unregenerate and carnal ſtate; what Conceptions Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion hath wrought in the nature and heart of man; here is a Horſeleach-Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and unſanctified Love, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſire in affinity with Self and the World, whereby is conceived in the heart, the wicked fruits of Envy, Pride,

                     <p>VVe are ready to lay all the fault up on the Devil, and ſo as the firſt moveing cauſe he was; But man was the Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al cauſe in yeilding to the ſerpentine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Our Saviour Chriſt was as ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tempted as man could be, yet he, in not yeilding thereto, could triumphing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay: <hi>The Prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me,</hi> John 14.30.

                     <p>The Devil is here ſaid to be the <hi>Prince of this world,</hi> as he by policy with ſubtil Temptation did prevail with man to transgreſs the will of God revealed, by which tranſgreſſion, man came to contract unto himſelf the natural princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and evill qualifications of the Devil: And by the vertue and opperation of the ſaid natural principles, and Evil quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, the Creature in its unregenerate

But when the appetite of the ſoul, or the affections are but weak to Righteouſneſs, and the ſtomack ſlow of digeſture, as to things of God; ſo that the Heavenly Manna is

                     <p>Thirdly: The glaſs of Gods word diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers, that, except a man deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs and follow Chriſt, he cannot be his Diſciple; and if any man love the world, the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not in him.</p>
                     <p>So when ſelf, and the world, are the Conceptions in the heart, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in our eye, as to hinder us in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of Chriſt in his Righteous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, ſo as not to give him the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence of our obedience; it is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſign the heart is diſeaſed with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid diſtempers, and hath need of a potion effectually applyed thereunto.</p>

                        <p>Fifthly: Chriſts freeneſs to Sinners, in their coming to him to partake of the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:152215:154"/> ſtreams of his fulneſs for a remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the aforeſaid diſtempers, is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſignified by his commending the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vertue and duration of thoſe ſtreams, as inducements to draw poor Sinners unto an eſteem thereof.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Whoſoever ſhall drink of the water that I ſhall give him,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ſhall never thirſt; but the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a Well of water, ſpringing up into everlaſting life.</hi> Whence obſerve, that a full ſatisfaction unto an eternal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is the natural vertue and effects of free grace unto every ſoul that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes thereof, by a union with Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly: A ſixth evidence of Chriſts free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Sinners, and of his deſire of their coming to him, to partake of the ſtreams of his fulneſs, is the teſtifications of his great diſpleaſure he takes againſt ſuch that obſtinately refuſe: <hi>And thoſe mine Enemies that would not that I ſhould raign over them, bring them hither and ſlay them before me,</hi> Luk. 19.27. Expreſſions teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying great diſpleaſure. <hi>Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed; I have ſtretched out my hand, and ye have not regarded; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall they eat of the fruit of their own doings, and be filled with their own devices,</hi> Prov. 1.24, 32.</p>
                        <pb n="277" facs="tcp:152215:154"/>
                        <p>Thus you have Chriſts free deſire of ſinners coming to him, and to partake of his fulneſs of Grace and Truth, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
                        <p>Firſt: By the means he uſeth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſinners of their need of him.</p>
                        <p>Secondly: By his Invitations to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to come unto him.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly: By his Promiſe of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of thoſe that come unto him.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly: By his Complaints or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs upon their not coming.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly: By his commending the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the vertue and duration of his ſtreams of free grace, as an inducement to ſinners to come.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly: By his teſtifying diſpleaſure againſt thoſe that refuſe and withſtand all means thereunto afforded.</p>
                        <p>Thus much concerning the third Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which is Chriſts freeneſs towards poor ſinners for their coming to him, and partaking of his benefits, which is a ſtrong inducement thereunto.</p>

This water of free grace, which we are ſo called and invited to by the Father, Son, and holy Spirit, and ſanctified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have taſted thereof, and from their experience commend it to us, is not only effectual to clarifie the heart of the aforeſaid <hi>Horſeleach,</hi> and her brood, but alſo to qualifie the heart with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine qualifications of grace, for nature and quality, like the Fountain whence they flow, to the evidencing of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection in Chriſt, our Adoption by Chriſt, our Juſtification through Chriſt, and our

And what is the Reaſon of this? ſurely ſelf and the world were retained in affinity with love and deſire, and therefore ſelf-ends and worldly intereſts becomes the wheel of motion in all the actions of the unſanctified heart; and is not this the cauſe and ground of that ſad complaint that the Lord by the Prophet taketh up
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:152215:164"/> againſt the Prieſts, and Prophets, and Judges of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old?

                        <p>But I would preſent to conſideration that more excellent way laid down by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which is the way of Charity, without which, all is nothing in the Lords eſteem, as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Though I ſpeak with the tongues of Men, and of Angels, and have not Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:152215:165"/> I am but as ſounding Braſs, and a tinkling Cymbal;</hi> And though I have the gift of Propheſie, and underſtand all myſteries, and all knowledge, yea, and all faith, ſo that I could remove Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and have no Charity, I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and though I give all my goods to feed the Poor, and my body to be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and have not Charity, it profits me nothing.</p>
                        <p>Whence <hi>Note,</hi> that our higheſt actions will not reach to Gods approvance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Charity be a compound in the ſame: Yea, ſo excellent is the nature and vertue of Charity, and of eſteem with God, that the meaneſt actions of it, be but the gift of a cup of cold water, where there is no better, if compounded with Charity, it hath the promiſe of reward; ſo highly is Charity in eſteem with the Lord. But happily ſome ſoul may queſtion in it ſelf, if not of ſome other, ſaying, what is Charity, that is of ſuch concernment: I Anſwer briefly, That Charity is a real affectionate love to the Lord, and all actions by the Creature, performed in this principle of love to the Lord, may be deemed actions of Charity, or Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actions; as when the Creature is drawn forth to do that which is the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:152215:165"/> will of the Lord, by the powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of real affectionate love unto the Lord, then the Creatures end, and aime, and drift, and ſcope in all its actions, will be honour, praiſe, and glory to the Lord, the object of its love.</p>
                        <p>Yea, by this principle of love to the Lord, the Creature is drawn forth with endeavours to vindicate, promote, and with high eſteem, prefer the name of the Lord, the intereſt of his truth, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for the Lords ſake, above all other things.</p>
                        <p>But why is this love to the Lord called Charity? and thoſe actions ariſing from thence, acts of Charity; and not that love in the Creature, that is fixed upon other objects here below, as ſelf and the world, which you have ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in this your former diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>This love to the Lord, may be called Charity.</p>
                        <p>Firſt: From the purity of its original, from whence it doth ariſe, which is the pure, eternal, free, and undeſerved love of God in Chriſt; the which by its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and operation upon the heart, doth work up the Creatures affections into its own nature to love the Lord, and all his intereſt for his ſake, and to demonſtrate
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:152215:166"/> this love unto the Lord, as occaſions do offer themſelves, and ability doth afford; and ſo Saint <hi>John</hi> lays the original cauſe of mans love to God, to be Gods love firſt made out to man: <hi>We love him</hi> (ſaith <hi>John) becauſe he loved us firſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly: It may be called Charity upon the conſideration of the purity of the object, upon whom it fixeth its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly: It may be called Charity, to diſtinguiſh the excellency of this love from, and above all love fixed upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther objects.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly: It may be called Charity, in conſideration of the purity and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the natural properties of it, which it worketh in thoſe hearts where it doth reſide; as ſaith the Apoſtle, Charity ſuffereth long, and is kind; Charity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieth not; Charity vaunteth not it ſelf, it is not puffed up; doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly, ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily provoked; thinketh no evil; rejoyceth not in Iniquity, but rejoyceth in the Truth; beareth all things; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth all things, hopeth all things; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth all things.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly: There is no love but is failable, except this of Charity; and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:152215:166"/> never faileth; and therefore Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly: There is no love hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward like this of Charity, for Charity hath an eternal reward in Glory annext unto it: So that when the Creatures actions do flow from this inward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of real love to the Lord, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with compounded, they become actions of Charity, and of high acceptation with the Lord: But when this ingredience is wanting, neither perſon, nor performance is approved of the Lord, as faith the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Zachariah,</hi> unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old: <hi>When ye faſted and mourned in the fifth and ſeaventh moneth, even thoſe ſeaventy years did ye at all faſt unto me, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto me; and when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for your ſelves, and drink for your ſelves?</hi> And whats the reaſon that their meat-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, drink-offerings, their faſtings and mournings, their ſolemn meetings, and religious ſervices found not acceptance with the Lord? Surely their hearts were deſtitute of Charity, there wanted this compound of a real love to the Lord, and a real deſire to promote the intereſt of his truth in the power and purity of it, to the glory of his Name, and to be an
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:152215:167"/> example to others thereunto: But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily all their performances were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dedicated to carnal ſelf and worldly intereſts, with whom the <hi>Horſeleach Daughters,</hi> their corrupt affections, were joyned in affinity; and therefore all was nothing in the Lords eſteem.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Many ſhall come to me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>in that day, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open unto us, have we not Propheſied in thy Name? and in thy Name caſt out Devils? and in thy Name done many wondrous works?

                  <p>ALthough in the laſt end of my Book reminded, yet in much reſpect are you upon my heart retained in the tender bowels of true Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection; wiſhing unto you, not only the bleſſing of me your Father, after the fleſh, but more eſpecially the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of him who is the Father of ſpirits unto your eſtabliſhment in his grace, mercy, peace, and unity in the truth, as it is in Jeſus, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all perſeverance through the knowledge of God our Father, and Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

                  <p>And having found the Bleſſing of God in ſome good meaſure attending the ſame, to your growth in civility and piety, unto my greater comfort; to the praiſe of God be it ſpoken, and to the encouragement of others in ſuch concernments.</p>
